        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Now that our users can place orders...we need to create a way for our
          staff to review and process those orders. This week we will add a
          simple Administrative portion of our site. This portion of the site
          should only be accessed by authenticated users.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment individually. Each student will
          write code for their own copy.
        </p>

        <div class="requirements">
          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Visit the team's copy of the Trello board for the project. Add
                yourself to the "Individual8: Authentication" task...then move
                it to 'Doing'. Read the details of the card.
              </p>
              <p>
                Make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from GitHub before
                proceeding. Create a new branch called
                <kbd>initials--individual8</kbd>. So if your name were John Doe
                the branch should be called <code>jd--individual8</code>
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Setup our Admin page</h3>
              <p>
                Create a new directory in the src directory called
                <kbd>admin</kbd>. Add an <kbd>index.html</kbd> and add the basic
                HTML we need as well as add the header and footer of the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create an <kbd>Admin.js</kbd> module as well. Add a class and
                two initial methods: <code>login</code>, and
                <code>showLogin</code>
              </p>
              <p>
                Finish writing the <code>showLogin</code> method. It should
                build a login form in the <code>main</code> element of our page.
                The form should include a box for email, password, and a submit
                button. When the button is clicked it should call the
                <code>login</code> method.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Logging in</h3>
              <p>
                Next we need to finish our <code>login</code> method. The server
                that we need to authenticate with to retrieve the order
                information has a login endpoint at this address:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">http://157.201.228.93:2992/login</code></pre>
              <p>
                We need to make a <code>POST</code> request to that address with
                the email and password the user provides as the body. Just to
                keep things consistent lets create a function in
                <kbd>ExternalServices</kbd> called
                <code>loginRequest(creds)</code> that will make the actual
                request to the server.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">{ email: "user1@email.com" , password: "user1" }</code></pre>
              <p>
                If our request is successful (email and password match a user in
                the database) then the server will return a token. This token
                must be provided with each additional request we make to the
                server. Save it as a property of the Admin class.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                If you get tired of typing <kbd>user1@email.com</kbd> you can
                add <code>value="user1@email.com"</code> to your email input
                element...and it will remember it. Just remember to remove it
                when you are done testing!
              </p>
              <p>This is how my <code>Admin.login</code> method ended up:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">constructor(outputSelector) {
    this.mainElement = document.querySelector(outputSelector);
    this.token = null;
    this.services = new ExternalServices();
  }
  async login(creds, next) {
  // I built the login method with a callback: next. 
  // This makes it much more flexible...
  // there could be many different things the user wants to do after logging in...
  // this allows us that flexibility without having to write a bunch of login methods
  try {
    this.token = await this.services.loginRequest(creds);
    next()
  } 
  catch(err) {
    // remember this from before?
    alertMessage(err.message.message);
  }
}</code></pre>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Getting the orders</h3>
              <p>The orders we are looking for can be found at</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">http://157.201.228.93:2992/orders</code></pre>
              <p>
                If you make a <code>GET</code> request to that address however
                you will get an error. This is a protected endpoint. We need to
                send our token along with our request so that the server knows
                we can be trusted. Tokens like this are usually included in the
                <kbd>headers</kbd> of the request.
              </p>
              <p>
                Add a header for our request called
                <code>Authorization</code> that will include our token. If you
                look in <kbd>ExternalServices->checkout</kbd> there is an
                example of using a custom header. If you decide to copy/paste
                that one, remember that we want to do a GET, which means we
                shouldn't have a <code>body</code> property.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will probably want to make a new method in
                <kbd>ExternalServices</kbd> to get the orders from the server,
                and another in <kbd>Admin</kbd> to kick off the request after
                login has finished successfully. The line you will want to add
                to the <code>headers</code> portion of your options should look
                like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
} </code></pre>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>

          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Display the orders</h3>
              <p>
                Write the code necessary to display the list of orders to the
                user.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                'Those aren't very detailed instructions', you may be saying to
                yourself...you are right! You shouldn't need detailed
                instructions for this part at this point :) Keep usability in
                mind when you do this however, and make it look good. Also...you
                probably do not want to display all of the information in the
                order. Put yourself in the shoes of someone needing to review
                and process these orders to fill them. What information would
                YOU like to see?
              </p>

        <h2>Instructor's Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this individual activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity individually for the one hour period. At the end of the hour,
          if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you
          are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working individually for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/team8/src"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, reviewed the instructor's
          solution, and gotten your code working, commit and push your changes.
          when you next meet with your team you should discuss with each other
          which changes you would like to keep. You should only keep ONE
          member's changes! Submit a pull request for the branch with the code
          you have decided to keep. Then review the pull request, close it, and
          merge the branch back into Main. Finally, move the Trello card to
          "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity before submitting the assessment.
