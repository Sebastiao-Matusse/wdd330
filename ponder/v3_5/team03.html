        <h1>Ponder: Team Activity 3</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will continue the process of making our site more
          dynamic. We will do this by addressing the home page. Eventually we
          will want to list out more products, so we need to make the product
          listing build dynamically based on provided data.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many spots where code examples have been given. To get the
          most out of this activity do not look at the examples until your group
          has given that section a try. Then after you look at the example
          resist the temptation to copy/paste. Use the examples to give
          correction, or help you get unstuck...do not just use them to get it
          done.
        </p>

            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team3: Dynamic product list" task...then move it to 'Doing'.
                Read the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team3</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team3</code>
              </p>

              <h3>Check Your Build</h3>
              <p>
                Last week we made some changes to the structure of our site. You
                should have had some pull requests created and merged at this
                point as well. Have you checked the "production" build of your
                site since then? Remember that we are deploying our site to
                Netlify. This deployment is actually automatic. Everytime you
                change the "main" branch of your site it will update Netlify.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can also check the production build locally. If you run
                <kbd>npm run build</kbd> it will update the files in the
                <kbd>dist</kbd> directory.
              </p>

              <p>
                Someone on the team should check the build periodically to make
                sure it is not broken. A good time to do this would be each time
                a pull request is merged!
              </p>

              <h3>Building Components</h3>
              <p>
                A very popular way to build web apps currently is by creating
                re-usable components. These components have all of the markup,
                styling, and functionality packaged up in an easy to use form.
                The module we made in the last activity followed this form to
                some extent. all we had to do to get a product to display with
                it's details was to call a function.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our module works, but has a few drawbacks with performance and
                implementation. Because it can be fairly difficult to solve
                those problems, and because almost everyone writing web
                applications runs into them many libraries and frameworks have
                been built to help.
              </p>
              <p>
                Part of your reading for this week was a
                <a href="https://preactjs.com/tutorial/">tutorial on Preact</a>.
                Preact is a small library (only 3KB!) that is very similar to
                React. We will be using it in our project starting with this
                week to help us build our re-usable components.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will also be using special
                <a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates"
                  >tagged template literals</a
                >
                for our templates. The tag provides our template literal with
                superpowers. We will be using a library called
                <a href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a> for this.
                Another common way to do this with React/Preact would be to use
                JSX
              </p>
              <p>
                We need to add preact to our project. Because we are already
                using a package manager (npm) and a bundler (Vite) this is
                really easy.
              </p>
              <p>Open the terminal in VSCode and run the following command:</p>
              <pre><code class="bash">npm install preact htm</code></pre>
              <p>
                That's it. We can now use these tools by importing them wherever
                we need.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->

              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>productList module</h3>
              <p>
                Create a new file <kbd>productList.mjs</kbd> that we will use
                for the code to generate a list of product cards in HTML from an
                array. Add a function called <kbd>ProductList</kbd> (It's common
                practice in Preact and React to name components in this way.
                CamelCased...but capitalized), export your function as default,
                and import it into <kbd>main.js</kbd>. You should also think
                about what other functions we will need to complete this task.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                Make sure that you add <kdb>main.js</kdb> into your index.html
                file with a script tag. Otherwise you may end up wondering why
                nothing you do has any effect!
              </p>
              <p>
                We will need to import in htm/preact as well. Add the following
                to the top of your file:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">import { html } from "htm/preact";</code></pre>
              <p>
                Begin creating your ProductList function by thinking about the
                information it will need to accomplish it's purpose.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually we will want to have more than one category of
                products, and list each out independently. Pass in the category
                of products we want.
              </p>

              <p>
                Finally we will need to read the product data out of the
                <kbd>tents.json</kbd> file (our current data source). We did
                something similar last week. Then we only needed one product,
                this time we need all of them. If you review the contents of our
                <code>productData</code> module, you will see a function
                <code>getData</code>. Import that into the module and use it to
                get the list of products from <kbd>tents</kbd>.
              </p>

              <pre><code class="lang-js">
export default function ProductList({ category }) {
    
    // get the list of products 
    // render out the product list to the element
    return html`&lt;p&gt;My new component&lt;/p&gt;`;
}
                </code></pre>

              <p>
                Then import your <code>ProductList</code> function into
                <kbd>main.js</kbd>. To get our component to show up we need to
                <code>render</code> it. The render function comes from Preact
                again so we need an import.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">import { html, render } from "htm/preact";</code></pre>
              <p>Then to render out component we can do the following:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">render(html`<${ProductList} category="tents" />`, document.querySelector('.products')</code></pre>
              <p>
                The render function takes two arguments: a component to render,
                and the element where we want it rendered. If you check the
                index page you should see the text from our component showing!
              </p>

              <h3>Working with templating</h3>
              <p>
                As you think about how to build out our list it would be good to
                break it down into parts:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>A title identifying the component</li>
                <li>A list</li>
                <li>
                  A collection of product summary cards in the list...one for
                  each product we want to display.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                A product summary card is something that we might want to reuse
                in another context. It would be good to make that a standalone
                component. Approaching this from a component based design we
                might decide to do the following:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
import { html } from "htm/preact";

function ProductSummary({ product }) {
    return html`&lt;li class="product-card"&gt;
    &lt;a href="product_pages/index.html?product=880RR"&gt;
        &lt;img
        src="images/tents/marmot-ajax-tent-3-person-3-season-in-pale-pumpkin-terracotta~p~880rr_01~320.jpg"
        alt="Marmot Ajax tent"
        /&gt;
        &lt;h3 class="card__brand"&gt;Marmot&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;h2 class="card__name"&gt;Ajax Tent - 3-Person, 3-Season&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p class="product-card__price"&gt;$199.99&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a
    &gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;`;
}

export default function ProductList({ category }) {
    let products = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    return html`&lt;h2&gt;Top Products&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;ul class="product-list"&gt;
        &lt;!-- one of the superpowers of the 'html' tag is that it can take the results of a .map directly...like this --&gt;
        ${products.map(
          (product) =&gt; html`&lt;${ProductSummary} product=${product} /&gt;`
        )}
      &lt;/ul&gt;`;
  }
              </code></pre>
              <p>Note a few things:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We can embed components as children of other components!
                </li>
                <li>
                  ProductSummary just has the html markup for one of our
                  products from index.html. We will change it later but this
                  willl work well for testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Notice that there is an <code>html</code> in front of our
                  template literal. This is what makes is a "tagged" template
                  literal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We can use <code>.map()</code> directly inside the template
                  literal!
                </li>
                <li>
                  We are using a simple array for products to make sure that the
                  loop works and we get the expected number of ProductSummary
                  components.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="callout">
                You may have noticed one of the disadvantages to using these
                template literal strings...we lose our auto-complete :( Not to
                fear. There is an extention for that! You may want to install
                <kbd>lit-html</kbd>.
              </p>

              <!-- <p>
                As we think about building our product list, each product card
                will have very similar markup. Templates are a way for us to
                reuse markup in an efficient way. Last week we were able to
                leave the markup in the HTML file, and just fill in the values
                with Javascript, but that won't work this week as we need
                multiple copies of the template. There are many ways that
                developers will handle templating issues. When choosing a
                templating solution you should keep a few things in mind:
              </p> -->

              <!-- <ol>
                <li>
                  Ideally the solution will maintain the separation of concerns.
                  It would be good if we left the HTML where it belongs...in the
                  .html file instead of buried in the javascript. This leads to
                  more maintainable code.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The html and css for a site is often managed by a different
                  group than the logic in the Javascript. If the HTML is in the
                  javascript then everytime a styling change needs to be made
                  the Javascript will have to be modified instead of just
                  changing the HTML. If your templating solution involves
                  embedding the HTML in the Javascript code, is it done in such
                  a way that does not require a high level of JS knowledge in
                  order to change a template?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Performance. Our templating solution should not lead to
                  performance issues.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Some of the options that are used can be found below:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the project is using a frontend framework or library like
                  React, Angular, Vue, Svelte,
                  <a
                    href="https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/#front_end_frameworks_experience_ranking"
                    >etc</a
                  >, the tool will usually have the templating solution built
                  in. You should really use the built in solution. (For more
                  information take WDD 430)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Server Side Rendering (SSR) We could use a server side
                  language like PHP, .NET, or NodeJS to insert the template when
                  the page was requested, but before it was sent. (For more
                  information take CSE 340 (PHP), CSE 341 (NodeJS), or CIT 365
                  (.NET))
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are templating solutions that become part of the
                  frontend build process. Tools like
                  <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>,
                  <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>,
                  <a href="https://pugjs.org/">pug</a>
                  <a
                    href="https://www.developerdrive.com/best-javascript-templating-engines/"
                    >etc</a
                  >. Most of these tools would be integrated into your workflow
                  through your bundler or task manager.

              <h3>Adding in the data</h3>
              <p>
                It's time to get some products. Before we do that, we need to
                review a couple of concepts from the Preact tutorial:
                <a href="https://preactjs.com/tutorial/04-state">State</a> and
                <a href="https://preactjs.com/tutorial/07-side-effects"
                  >side effects</a
                >
              </p>

              <p>
                We will use a side effect to get the list of products we need
                when the component first loads, we will store the list of
                products in State. We need first to import these hooks.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">import { useState, useEffect } from "htm/preact";</code></pre>
              <p>Declare a state variable along with it's setter:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);</code></pre>
              <p>
                Then we need to declare a function that will take care of
                initializing our component. It would use the
                <code>getData</code> function from productData.mjs to get the
                list of products and set them into our products state.
              </p>
              <p>Then call our init function with <code>useEffect</code></p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">export default function ProductList({ category }) {
const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);

console.log("enter", products);

async function init() {
    // get the products
    const data = await getData(category);
    // set the products into our state variable.
    setProducts(data);
    console.log("init", data, products);
}
// the empty [] means that this will run once the first time the component is mounted.
useEffect(init, []);

return html`&lt;h2&gt;Top Products&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul class="product-list"&gt;
    &lt;!-- one of the superpowers of the 'html' tag is that it can take the results of a .map directly...like this --&gt;
    ${products.map(
        (product) =&gt; html`&lt;${ProductSummary} product=${product} /&gt;`
    )}
    &lt;/ul&gt;`;
}</code></pre>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Stop here and make sure that things are working. Check your
                  console and see if you can figure out what is going on. If
                  things are working correctly you should see something like
                  this:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="lang-markup">
[Log] enter – [] (0) (productList.mjs, line 22)
[Log] init (2) (productList.mjs, line 29)
    [Object, Object, Object, Object, Object, Object] (6)
    [] (0)
[Log] enter – [Object, Object, Object, …] (6) (productList.mjs, line 22)
        </code></pre>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Note the first "enter" log. It shows that when the component
                    first loaded products was an empty array. This is what we
                    would expect.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Then we see "init". This means the useEffect triggered and
                    ran out init function. The first thing logged is
                    <kbd>data</kbd>, the second thing logged is
                    <kbd>products</kbd>. Why is <kbd>products</kbd> still empty?
                    We called <code>setProducts</code>!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Finally we see another "enter" log which means our component
                    reloaded. This time <kbd>products</kbd> has the data we
                    would expect.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  What is going on? The first time the component loads our state
                  variables are setup and initialized. Anytime our state
                  variables change from here on out it will force the component
                  to RELOAD!
                </p>
                <p>
                  So when <code>useEffect</code> ran <code>init</code>, we
                  <em>requested</em> an update of <code>products</code> with
                  <code>setProducts</code>. This update triggered a reload...but
                  an important thing to note is that <code>products</code>
                  <em
                    >does NOT update until the next render of the component!</em
                  >
                </p>
              </div>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>

          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Finish it up</h3>
              <p>
                Now that we have actual products, update the
                <code>ProductSummary</code> component to insert the correct
                variables into your template. Then test again to make sure
                everything is displaying correctly. Remember to remove the hard
                coded products in the <kbd>/index.html</kbd> file so we don't
                have any duplicates. Don't forget to insert in the product.Id
                into the href in the link!
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Remove extra products</h3>
              <p>
                <kbd>tents.json</kbd> has more tents than we currently need.
                Write a method in <kbd>productList.mjs</kbd> that will filter
                our list of products to just the 4 we need. Use that method to
                show only those 4 tents.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a

        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, reviewed the instructor's
          solution, and gotten your code working the driver should commit and
          push their changes then submit a pull request for this branch. Then
          review the pull request as a team, close it, and merge the branch back
          into Main. Finally someone should move the Trello card to "Done".
