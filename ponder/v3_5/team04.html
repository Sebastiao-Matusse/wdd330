        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will finish the process of converting our site to a
          dynamic site by making the header and footer components that can be
          managed in one location.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many spots where code examples have been given. To get the
          most out of this activity do not look at the examples until your group
          has given that section a try. Then after you look at the example
          resist the temptation to copy/paste. Use the examples to give
          correction, or help you get unstuck...do not just use them to get it
          done.
        </p>

                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team4: Dynamic header and footer" task...then move it to
                'Doing'. Read the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team4</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team4</code>

              <h3>Plan</h3>
              <p>
                As you completed the reading for this week there were two
                articles about Single Page Applications (SPA). One outlining
                what they are, and another indicating some of the drawbacks to
                them. At this point we need to decide if a Single Page
                Application is the right architecture for our application.
                Discuss with your group your feelings. You may want to pull up
                the two articles (<a

                alternatives.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once you are done with your discussion, review the information
                below with the instructor's recommendation and reasoning. Keep
                in mind that there is no one right answer here. There's more
                than one way to skin a cat...as the old adage goes. You may
                disagree with the conclusion or reasoning and that is fine...but
                because the future activities will make certain assumptions
                about the structure of your app I would recommend that you still
                follow the recommendation below.

                <div>
                  <p>SPAs can be great in the right circumstances:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Once the page has downloaded, switching between views is
                      usually very fast
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In complex applications where there is a lot of state to
                      manage SPAs make it easier
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      when you need a very native application type of a feel.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>But they do come with a few drawbacks:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Initial load times are often higher...people are most
                      sensitive to initial load times...first impressions...
                    </li>
                    <li>SPAs are more complex than multipage apps</li>
                    <li>
                      SPAs often require more processing power on the
                      client...so older less powerful computers and phones might
                      struggle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You lose some great native features of browsers like
                      history
                    </li>
                    <li>SEO often becomes hard</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In the case of our application I'm not sure the additional
                    complexities added by converting to a SPA are worth the
                    extra work and complexity it will introduce:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      We don't have complex state that needs to persist from one
                      page to another. The product listing page for example
                      really doesn't care what happens on the product detail
                      page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It would be really nice to not have to write our own
                      routing and history functionality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This really isn't trying to duplicate a native app...so a
                      bit of flash on a page load isn't going to feel too out of
                      place.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      As a retail site initial loading speed needs to be as fast
                      as possible...and SEO is really important to get new
                      customers to the site.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In our case a SPA would be overkill, but there are some
                    advantages to dynamically generating parts of the site. I
                    like the hybrid approach introduced in the second article.
                    We should implement something along those lines. The good
                    news is that what we have done already follows that model.

              <h3>Header and Footer</h3>
              <p>
                The code for the Header and Footer of our site should be the
                same (or nearly) on all pages. We currently have 4 copies of
                those...one on each .html file in the site. If we need to make a
                change to the header we will have to visit each page to keep
                them the same. That is a bother with 4 pages...it becomes
                unmanageable with larger sites. Just as it was for the product
                list, templating can be a solution here as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just like in the last activity we can leverage reusable
                components for our header and footer. Create two new files in
                the JS folder: <kbd>mainHeader.mjs</kbd> and
                <kbd>mainFooter.mjs</kbd>. Import in the <kbd>htm</kbd> library
                like we did last time, then create a function in each as the
                default export. Each of those functions should have a return
                statement with a tagged template literal.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then copy the html from
                <em>inside</em> of the header and footer elements from the
                src/index.html page into the respective file. We should then add
                an id to the header and footer elements in index. In the end for
                the header your code should look something like this (don't just
                copy this code! Your code might have changes to it that are not
                represented here. Copy the code out of your index.html file!):
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-markup">
&lt;div class="logo"&gt;
  &lt;img src="/images/noun_Tent_2517.svg" alt="tent image for logo"&gt;
  &lt;a href="index.html"&gt; Sleep&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Outside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cart"&gt;
  &lt;a href="cart.html"&gt;
    &lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100"&gt;
      ...all the SVG code ...
    &lt;/svg&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
              <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;!-- index.html --&gt;
&lt;header class="divider" id="main-header"&gt;
  
&lt;/header&gt;
</code></pre>
              <p>
                To load our templates we will use the render function from
                Preact again. We will need to call this function twice for every
                page in our site. Once for the header and once for the footer.
                To streamline this we should create a helper module.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Create one more file in the JS folder called
                  <kbd>renderHeaderFooter.mjs</kbd>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Add a function called <code>renderHeaderFooter</code> and
                  export it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In that function render out the header and footer components
                  to the correct elements when called.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Update <kbd>main.js</kbd>. Import in
                  <code>renderHeaderFooter</code> and then use that function to
                  load the header and footer into <kbd>src/index.html</kbd>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do the same thing for
                  <kbd>product_pages/index.html</kbd>,
                  <kbd>cart/index.html</kbd> and
                  <kbd>checkout/index.html</kbd> (you will probably need to
                  create a <kbd>checkout.js</kbd> file for this)
                </li>
              </ol>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Adding a Cart count</h3>
              <p>
                Our header and footer are currently static, meaning that they
                are always the same. It would be nice however if a user of our
                site always had a visual indicator of how many items they
                currently had in their cart. We will do this next.
              </p>
              <p>
                Information can be passed into Preact components using what are
                know as props. You actually saw an example of this last activity
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">export default function ProductList({ category }) {</code></pre>
              <p>We used that component like this:</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">&lt;${ProductList} category="tents" /&gt;</code></pre>
              <p>
                Notice that we are passing in information to our custom
                <em>element</em> the same way we would pass information into
                <em>any</em> element: through attributes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any attributes added to one of our components get passed on to
                the function in an object called <code>props</code>. Children
                also get passed this way. That is often destructured as the
                example above to grab just the parts we need. The three
                following code snippets accomplish the same thing:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">function ProductList(props) {
    const category = props.category;
    console.log(category);
}
                </code></pre>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">function ProductList(props) {
    const { category } = props;
    console.log(category);
}
                </code></pre>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">function ProductList({category}) {
    console.log(category);
}
                </code></pre>

              <p>
                We should take advantage of this to pass in a count to our
                header component. Change your
                <code>renderHeaderFooter</code> function to include a
                <kbd>cartCount</kbd> attribute. You can just set it to a number
                for now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next modify the <code>MainHeader</code> component to catch the
                prop and use it. Give this a try before reviewing the example
                below
              </p>
              <details>
                <summary>MainHeader</summary>
                <pre><code class="lang-js">// productList.mjs
import { html } from "htm/preact";
export default function MainHeader({ cartCount }) {
    return html`&lt;div class="logo"&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/noun_Tent_2517.svg" alt="tent image for logo" /&gt;
        &lt;a href="index.html"&gt; Sleep&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Outside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="cart"&gt;
        &lt;a href="cart/index.html"&gt;
        &lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100"&gt;
        &lt;!-- ...svg contents removed for brevity --&gt;
            &lt;/svg
        &gt;&lt;sup class="cart-count"&gt;${cartCount}&lt;/sup&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;`;
}

// renderHeaderFooter.mjs
render(
    html`&lt;${MainHeader} cartCount=${cartCount} /&gt;`,
    document.querySelector("#main-header")
  );

              <h3>Finish the cart count</h3>
              <p>
                You should see a number next to the backpack cart icon now...but
                it is static. This number should reflect the actual number of
                items in the cart. Add the code necessary to make this happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                How can we get the number in the header to automatically update
                when a new item is added without reloading the entire page?
              </p>
              <p>
                How could you hide the number if there are no items in the cart?
              </p>

              <p>
                Cart was already a dynamic page. It read the list of items out
                of localStorage and then built the HTML to display them. It
                needs to be updated however to match the rest of the
                application. We should create a
                <kbd>shoppingCart.mjs</kbd> module similar to what we did for
                <kbd>productList</kbd>. We should also convert it to use a
                component like we did for the productList as well.
              </p>

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/v3.5-team4/src"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, reviewed the instructor's
          solution, and gotten your code working the driver should commit and
          push their changes then submit a pull request for this branch. Then
          review the pull request as a team, close it, and merge the branch back
          into Main. Finally someone should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
