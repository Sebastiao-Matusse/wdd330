        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will finish the process of converting our site to a
          dynamic site.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many spots where code examples have been given. To get the
          most out of this activity do not look at the examples until your group
          has given that section a try. Then after you look at the example
          resist the temptation to copy/paste. Use the examples to give
          correction, or help you get unstuck...do not just use them to get it
          done.
        </p>

              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team4: Dynamic header and footer" task...then move it to
                'Doing'. Read the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team4</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team4</code>

              <h3>Plan</h3>
              <p>
                As you completed the reading for this week there were two
                articles about Single Page Applications (SPA). One outlining
                what they are, and another indicating some of the drawbacks to
                them. At this point we need to decide if a Single Page
                Application is the right architecture for our application.
                Discuss with your group your feelings. You may want to pull up
                the two articles (<a

                alternatives.
              </p>
              <!-- <ul>
                <li>
                  I would recommend having a one-to-one relationship with
                  views/pages and modules. Then any functionality that needs to
                  be shared between modules can be placed in utility modules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The following views are needed: productList, productDetail,
                  cart, checkout
                </li>
                <li>
                  productList and productDetail are going to be mostly dynamic,
                  so let's just generate those entirely through Javascript.
                </li>
                <li>
                  cart and checkout will have more static content on them...so
                  let's load in an html partial as a starting point, and then
                  modify as needed with Javascript.
                </li>
              </ul> -->

                Once you are done with your discussion, review the information
                below with the instructor's recommendation and reasoning. Keep
                in mind that there is no one right answer here. There's more
                than one way to skin a cat...as the old adage goes. You may
                disagree with the conclusion or reasoning and that is fine...but
                because the future activities will make certain assumptions
                about the structure of your app I would recommend that you still
                follow the recommendation below.

                <div>
                  <p>SPAs can be great in the right circumstances:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Once the page has downloaded, switching between views is
                      usually very fast
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      In complex applications where there is a lot of state to
                      manage SPAs make it easier
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      when you need a very native application type of a feel.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>But they do come with a few drawbacks:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Initial load times are often higher...people are most
                      sensitive to initial load times...first impressions...
                    </li>
                    <li>SPAs are more complex than multipage apps</li>
                    <li>
                      SPAs often require more processing power on the
                      client...so older less powerful computers and phones might
                      struggle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You lose some great native features of browsers like
                      history
                    </li>
                    <li>SEO often becomes hard</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In the case of our application I'm not sure the additional
                    complexities added by converting to a SPA are worth the
                    extra work and complexity it will introduce:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      We don't have complex state that needs to persist from one
                      page to another. The product listing page for example
                      really doesn't care what happens on the product detail
                      page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      It would be really nice to not have to write our own
                      routing and history functionality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      This really isn't trying to duplicate a native app...so a
                      bit of flash on a page load isn't going to feel too out of
                      place.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      As a retail site initial loading speed needs to be as fast
                      as possible...and SEO is really important to get new
                      customers to the site.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In our case a SPA would be overkill, but there are some
                    advantages to dynamically generating parts of the site. I
                    like the hybrid approach introduced in the second article.
                    We should implement something along those lines. The good
                    news is that what we have done already follows that model.

              <h3>Header and Footer</h3>
              <p>
                The code for the Header and Footer of our site should be the
                same (or nearly) on all pages. We currently have 4 copies of
                those...one on each .html file in the site. If we need to make a
                change to the header we will have to visit each page to keep
                them the same. That is a bother with 4 pages...it becomes
                unmanageable with larger sites. Just as it was for the product
                list, templating can be a solution here as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a difference this time however...we will only have one
                copy of our template, and there is little information that needs
                to be updated...the header and footer are mostly static. Instead
                of embedding the template in Javascript like we did with the
                product listing, this time we will pull the template HTML into a
                separate file that we can load in with AJAX.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create another directory called <kbd>partials</kbd> (make sure
                you put this in the <kbd>src</kbd> directory) and create two
                files in it: <kbd>header.html</kbd> and <kbd>footer.html</kbd>.
                Then copy the html from <em>inside</em> of the header and footer
                elements from the src/index.html page into the respective file.
                We should then add an id to the header and footer elements in
                index. In the end for the header your code should look something
                like this (don't just copy this code! Your code might have
                changes to it that are not represented here. Copy the code out
                of your index.html file!):
              </p>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cart"&gt;

    &lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100"&gt;
      ...all the SVG code ...
    &lt;/svg&gt;

</code></pre>
              <p>
                To load our templates we could start with the
                <code>renderListWithTemplate</code> function we wrote last week,
                but will need to make some changes. We are only rendering one
                template instead of a list. We also need to write a function to
                request the html file with our header and footer.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Copy the <code>renderListWithTemplate</code> function and
                  paste it into our utils.js module. Rename it to
                  <code>renderWithTemplate</code>. Modify the function to remove
                  the loop and instead of passing in a <kbd>list</kbd>, let's
                  pass in <kbd>data</kbd>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The header should be mostly static HTML. If your group has
                  completed the cart icon cards (animation or number of items)
                  however, you may need to add that functionality back in. This
                  is a great usecase for a callback function, but the callback
                  will not always be necessary. Add an if statement in
                  <code>renderWithTemplate</code> that checks for the existence
                  of the callback parameter, if it exists then call it.
                  <details>
                    <summary>
                      Click for example code (<kbd>utils.js</kbd>)
                    </summary>
                    <pre><code class="lang-js">
export function renderWithTemplate(template, parent, data, callback) {
    parentElement.insertAdjacentHTML("afterbegin", template);
    if(callback) {
        callback(data);
    }
}</code></pre>
                  </details>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create another function in utils.js called
                  <code>loadTemplate(path)</code>. In this function we need to
                  make a fetch request to the provided path, then process the
                  response as <kbd>text</kbd>. (We have usually processed our
                  responses as JSON!)
                </li>

                <li>
                  Create one more function in utils.js called
                  <kbd>loadHeaderFooter</kbd>. It needs to do the following:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Load the header and footer templates in from our partials.
                      (<code>loadTemplate</code>)
                    </li>
                    <li>Grab the header and footer elements out of the DOM</li>
                    <li>
                      Render the header and footer
                      (<code>renderWithTemplate</code>.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Update <kbd>main.js</kbd>. Import in
                  <code>loadHeaderFooter</code> and then use that function to
                  load the header and footer into <kbd>src/index.html</kbd>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do the same thing for
                  <kbd>product_pages/index.html</kbd>,
                  <kbd>cart/index.html</kbd> and
                  <kbd>cart/checkout.html</kbd> (you will probably need to
                  create a <kbd>checkout.js</kbd> file for this)
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h3>Refactor the Cart</h3>
              <p>
                Cart was already a dynamic page. It read the list of items out
                of localStorage and then built the HTML to display them. It
                needs to be updated however to match the rest of the
                application. We should create a
                <kbd>ShoppingCart.js</kbd> module similar to what we did for
                <kbd>ProductList</kbd>. We should also convert it to use a
                <kbd>template</kbd> like we did for the ProductList as well.
              </p>

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.

          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
