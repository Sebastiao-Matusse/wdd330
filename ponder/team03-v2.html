        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will continue the process of making our site more
          dynamic. We will do this by addressing the home page. Eventually we
          will want to list out more products, so we need to make the product
          listing build dynamically based on provided data.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many spots where code examples have been given. To get the
          most out of this activity do not look at the examples until your group
          has given that section a try. Then after you look at the example
          resist the temptation to copy/paste. Use the examples to give
          correction, or help you get unstuck...do not just use them to get it
          done.
        </p>

                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team3: Dynamic product list" task...then move it to 'Doing'.

                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team3</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team3</code>

              <h3>Check Your Build</h3>
              <p>
                Last week we made some changes to the structure of our site. You
                should have had some pull requests created and merged at this
                point as well. Have you checked the "production" build of your
                site since then? Remember that we are deploying our site to
                Netlify. This deployment is actually automatic. Everytime you
                change the "main" branch of your site it will update Netlify.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can also check the production build locally. If you run
                <kbd>npm run build</kbd> it will update the files in the
                <kbd>dist</kbd> directory. You should do this periodically to
                check to make sure nothing is broken!
              </p>
              <p>
                If you visit your site on Netlify you will probably see that
                some things are broken!
              </p>
              <p>
                Before moving on go ahead and run <kbd>npm run build</kbd>. We
                can get Vite to preview that build directory as well by adding a
                new command to our <kbd>package.json</kbd> file. Add the
                following: <code>"preview": "vite preview",</code> to the
                scripts section, then run it. Check to see what still works and
                what is broken. (You always need run
                <kbd>npm run build</kbd> before you run
                <kbd>npm run preview</kbd> after you have made any changes.)
              </p>
              <p>
                When we made the changes to the product details page last week,
                we forgot to update Vite so that it knew about the changes.
                Let's do that now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Open up the <kbd>vite.config.js</kbd> file. Note the section
                that looks like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
build: {
  outDir: "../dist",
  rollupOptions: {
    input: {
      main: resolve(__dirname, "src/index.html"),
      cart: resolve(__dirname, "src/cart/index.html"),
      product1: resolve(
        __dirname,
        "src/product_pages/cedar-ridge-rimrock-2.html"
      ),
      product2: resolve(__dirname, "src/product_pages/marmot-ajax-3.html"),
      product3: resolve(
        __dirname,
        "src/product_pages/northface-alpine-3.html"
      ),
      product4: resolve(
        __dirname,
        "src/product_pages/northface-talus-4.html"
      ),
    },
  },
},
              </code></pre>
              <p>
                We aren't using the specific product pages anymore, and instead
                have an <kbd>index.html</kbd> file that we need to let our
                bundler know about. Change that section so that it looks like
                this instead:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">
build: {
  outDir: "../dist",
  rollupOptions: {
    input: {
      main: resolve(__dirname, "src/index.html"),
      cart: resolve(__dirname, "src/cart/index.html"),
      product: resolve(__dirname, "src/product_pages/index.html"
      ),
      
    },
  },
},
                </code></pre>
              <p>
                Anytime we add or remove more .HTML files to the site we will
                need to update this config or the production version of our site
                will break!
              </p>
              <p>
                We need to make one more build tool related change. If you look
                inside of the <kbd>dist</kbd> directory...you will notice that
                the <code>.json</code> files from the json folder are not there!
                Vite doesn't know it needs to copy them over.
              </p>
              <p>
                The easiest way to fix this would be to create a new directory
                called <kbd>src/public</kbd>. Then move the
                <kbd>json</kbd> directory into that new folder. Vite will
                automatically copy everything in the <kbd>public</kbd> folder
                over to the build.
              </p>
              <p>
                You should move the <kbd>images</kbd> directory into the
                <kbd>public</kbd> directory as well.
              </p>

              <h3>Read the Data</h3>
              <p>
                Our first task is to read the product data out of the
                <kbd>tents.json</kbd> file (our current data source). Lucky for
                us we did that same thing last week...Import the
                <code>ProductData</code> module into <kbd>main.js</kbd>
                and create an instance of it.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>ProductListing class</h3>
              <p>
                Create a new file <kbd>ProductList.mjs</kbd> that we will use
                for the code to generate a list of product cards in HTML from an
                array. Add a class called <kbd>ProductList</kbd>, and think
                about what methods we will need to complete this task. Export
                your class as default, and import it into <kbd>main.js</kbd>.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                Make sure that you add <kdb>main.js</kdb> into your index.html
                file with a script tag. Otherwise you may end up wondering why
                nothing you do has any effect!
              </p>
              <p>
                Begin creating your ProductList module by writing the code for
                the constructor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually we will want to have more than one category of
                products, and list each out independently. In your constructor
                you should let the class know which category of products we
                want.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to make our class as flexible and reusable as possible
                let's also pass in the HTML element we want the product list to
                render to, and we should send in our dataSource.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally we will need to use our dataSource to get the list of
                products we will be working with. We could do that in the
                constructor, or in an <code>init()</code> method. One advantage
                of the init method is it will allow us to use async/await.

    this.category = category;
    this.dataSource = dataSource;

  }
  async init() {
    // our dataSource will return a Promise...so we can use await to resolve it.
    const list = await this.dataSource.getData();
    // render the list 
  }

              <p>
                Then create an instance of your <code>ProductList</code> class
                in <kbd>main.js</kbd> and make sure that you can see the list of
                products. (use console.log or a breakpoint) Review the code from
                the week 2 team activity if you need help remembering how to do
                this.

              <h3>Working with templating</h3>
              <p>
                As we think about building our product list, each product card
                will have very similar markup. Templates are a way for us to
                reuse markup in an efficient way. Last week we were able to
                leave the markup in the HTML file, and just fill in the values
                with Javascript, but that won't work this week as we need
                multiple copies of the template. There are many ways that
                developers will handle templating issues. When choosing a
                templating solution you should keep a few things in mind:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Ideally the solution will maintain the separation of concerns.
                  It would be good if we left the HTML where it belongs...in the
                  .html file instead of buried in the javascript. This leads to
                  more maintainable code.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The html and css for a site is often managed by a different
                  group than the logic in the Javascript. If the HTML is in the
                  javascript then everytime a styling change needs to be made
                  the Javascript will have to be modified instead of just
                  changing the HTML. If your templating solution involves
                  embedding the HTML in the Javascript code, is it done in such
                  a way that does not require a high level of JS knowledge in
                  order to change a template?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Performance. Our templating solution should not lead to
                  performance issues.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Some of the options that are used can be found below:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the project is using a frontend framework or library like
                  React, Angular, Vue, Svelte,
                  <a
                    href="https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/#front_end_frameworks_experience_ranking"
                    >etc</a
                  >, the tool will usually have the templating solution built
                  in. You should really use the built in solution. (For more
                  information take WDD 430)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Server Side Rendering (SSR) We could use a server side
                  language like PHP, .NET, or NodeJS to insert the template when
                  the page was requested, but before it was sent. (For more
                  information take CSE 340 (PHP), CSE 341 (NodeJS), or CIT 365
                  (.NET))
                </li>
                <li>
                  There are templating solutions that become part of the
                  frontend build process. Tools like
                  <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>,
                  <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>,
                  <a href="https://pugjs.org/">pug</a>
                  <a
                    href="https://www.developerdrive.com/best-javascript-templating-engines/"
                    >etc</a
                  >. Most of these tools would be integrated into your workflow
                  through your bundler or task manager.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use the
                  <a
                    href="https://dev.to/ahferroin7/the-html5-template-element-26b6"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer"
                    >&lt;template&gt;</a
                  >
                  tag in HTML with some Javascript to roll your own solution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use template literal strings in Javascript to roll your own
                  solution.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Because our templating needs are pretty light, we are going to
                go with one of the simplest templating solutions on the
                list...template literal strings. Some of the other options
                provide more functionality, and in some cases better
                scaling...but at the cost of more complexity.
              </p>

              <p>
                We will create a template function for each of the templates we
                need that will simply return a template literal string. At the
                top of your <kbd>ProductList</kbd> module add a function for a
                <code>productCardTemplate(product)</code>. You can use the
                current HTML in the <kbd>/index.html</kbd> file as your starting
                point.
              </p>
              <details>
                <summary>productCardTemplate() example</summary>

                <pre><code class="lang-js">
// ProductList.mjs
function productCardTemplate(product) {
    return `&lt;li class="product-card"&gt;
    &lt;a href="product_pages/index.html?product="&gt;
    &lt;img
      src=""
      alt="Image of "
    /&gt;
    &lt;h3 class="card__brand"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;h2 class="card__name"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p class="product-card__price"&gt;$&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;`
}             </code></pre>
              </details>
              <p>
                Add a method to your ProductList class to use this template
                called <code>renderList</code>, call the template function once
                for each product in our list, and insert it to the DOM. The

                <code>map</code> is great way to transform data objects into

              <p>
                You should have some product cards showing, but they are all the
                same and are missing critical information. The next step is to
                insert the specific product information into the HTML template.
                This is why we used a template literal string...so we could take
                advantage of the variable interpolation it provides.
              </p>
              <p>
                Insert the correct variables into your template. Then test again
                to make sure everything is displaying correctly. Remember to
                remove the hard coded products in the
                <kbd>/index.html</kbd> file so we don't have any duplicates.

              <p>
                The code for your <code>renderList</code> method probably looks
                something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js line-numbers">renderList(list) {
    const htmlStrings =  list.map(productCardTemplate);
    this.listElement.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', htmlStrings.join(''));
}</code></pre>
              <p>
                Taking a list of data objects, converting it into HTML, and
                inserting it into a DOM element seems like something that could
                happen a lot. Right now our function is embedded in the
                <code>ProductList</code> class...which makes it not very
                reusable. We will probably need to generate more content with
                templates so let's make this function reusable. Look for all the
                parts of the code that are specific to this use case: making a
                list of product cards.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The element we want to insert the new HTML into is being
                  provided by the class: <kbd>this.listElement</kbd>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The template function we will use is hard coded:
                  <kbd>productCardTemplate</kbd>
                </li>
                <li>
                  We have also hard coded the position of the inserted HTML:
                  <code>afterbegin</code>, this might not always be the desired
                  case. We might also sometimes want to clear out the contents
                  of the element first.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The list of products is also specific, but we are already
                passing that in.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dealing with items 1, and 3 is easy...those require simple
                values we can pass in. But what about #2, the function? Remember
                that functions can be passed into other functions in Javascript.
                (Search 'js callbacks' or 'js higher order functions' for more
                depth). Make a new function in
                <kbd>utils.js</kbd> called
                <code>renderListWithTemplate</code> and export it.
              </p>
              <p>
                It should take 5 arguments: templateFn, parentElement, list,
                position, and clear. Then move the code from your
                <code>renderList</code> function over to utils.js and refactor
                it to work with the new parameters.
              </p>
              <p>
                Often <code>afterbegin</code> will be the position we want to
                insert into, and often we may not want to clear out the
                contents. When you declare your function set a default value for
                those two parameters.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">function renderListWithTemplate(templateFn, parentElement, list, position = "afterbegin", clear = false)</code></pre>
              <p>
                Add the logic to your function to clear out the element provided
                if <code>clear</code> is true.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then import in your function to the
                <kbd>ProductList</kbd> module, and refactor
                <code>renderList</code> to use our new utility function.
              </p>

            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Remove extra products</h3>
              <p>
                <kbd>tents.json</kbd> has more tents than we currently need.
                Write a method in <kbd>productList.js</kbd> that will filter our

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a

        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, reviewed the instructor's
          solution, and gotten your code working the driver should commit and
          push their changes then submit a pull request for this branch. Then
          review the pull request as a team, close it, and merge the branch back
          into Main. Finally someone should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
