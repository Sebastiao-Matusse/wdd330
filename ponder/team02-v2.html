        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will review the tools introduced last week, and begin
          the process of making our application scalable by adding dynamically
          generated product detail pages, and more organization using ESModules.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many spots where code examples have been given. To get the
          most out of this activity, do not look at the examples until your
          group has given that section a try. Then after you look at the
          example, resist the temptation to copy/paste. Use the examples to get
          correction, or help you get unstuck...do not just use them to get it
          done.
        </p>

          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team2: Dynamic product detail pages" task...then move it to
                'Doing'. Read the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                GitHub before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team2</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team2</code>
              </p>

              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Plan</h3>
              <p>
                We currently have one HTML file for each product we offer. This
                works okay when there are only 4 products, but we have plans to
                expand our inventory. We cannot continue with this model. The
                product pages all follow a similar template. There should be one
                HTML file that loads the details about the requested product
                through JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally as our code becomes more complex we will be well
                served by organizing it using ESModules.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Our goal will be to eventually have a one to one relationship
                  with views/pages and modules. Then any functionality that
                  needs to be shared between modules can be placed in a utility
                  module.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will begin now by creating a module
                  (<kbd>ProductDetails.mjs</kbd>) to contain the code we will
                  need to dynamically produce our product detail pages.
                </li>

                <li>
                  It's very likely that other parts of our application will need
                  to make requests for product data. That functionality has
                  already been exposed in the <kbd>ProductData.mjs</kbd> module.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There will likely be other functionality that needs to be
                  shared between parts of the application, you should notice
                  that there is already a
                  <kbd>utils.mjs</kbd> module to hold those.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>product-details.html</h3>
              <p>
                Instead of having an HTML file per product like we do currently,
                for scalability we would like one HTML file for all products
                that has some JavaScript in it to load the details. We need to
                create this HTML file. Open one of your current product pages in
                the editor, and file->Save As->
                <kbd>/product_pages/index.html</kbd>
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <h3>IMPORTANT!</h3>
                <p>
                  Make sure that you are working in the <kbd>src</kbd> directory
                  and NOT the <kbd>dist</kbd> directory! The build directory
                  will get erased and completely rebuilt each time you run
                  <kbd>npm run build</kbd>. Think of <kbd>dist</kbd> as the
                  production version of your code. <kbd>src</kbd> is your
                  working directory. You should not need to run
                  <kbd>npm run build</kbd> very often...like once a week after
                  you have merged some branches.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you run <kbd>npm run start</kbd> it will use the files in
                  <kbd>src</kbd>.
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                We have one additional change to make right now as well. If you
                open up the <kbd>vite.config.js</kbd> file you will see a
                listing of all of the HTML files that are part of the project.
                We just changed that so we need to update this file or our site
                will break on production! It currently looks like this:
              </p>

              <p>
                Open up the <kbd>ProductData.mjs</kbd> module file. Note a few

  }
}

export default class ProductData  {
  constructor(category) {
    this.category = category;
    this.path = `../json/${this.category}.json`;
  }
  getData() {
    return fetch(this.path)
      .then(convertToJson).then((data) => data);
  }
  async findProductById(id) {
    const products = await this.getData()
    return products.find((item) => item.Id === id);
  }
}
                  </code></pre>
              </details>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  In order to make our module portable and easy to use, it uses
                  a class to expose all the public facing code from our module.
                  It is called <code>ProductData</code>, and it is the default
                  export.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We will eventually want to use this class for more than just
                  tents. We can do that by using the constructor to the class.
                  If we pass in a category name (i.e. 'tents'), the class will
                  store it and also use it to build a path to the correct file
                  (i.e.
                  <code>this.path = `../json/${this.category}.json`;</code> ).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Notice the <code>getData()</code> method compared to the
                  <code>findProductById()</code> method. One uses just promises
                  and <code>.then()</code>, the other uses
                  <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"
                    target="_blank"
                    >async/await</a
                  >. Many find the async/await syntax to be easier to read (and
                  write) than the typical <code>.then()</code> based promise
                  handling.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the syntax on line 16 <code>(data) => data</code> is
                  confusing you may want to spend more time reading about arrow
                  functions in JavaScript. You could re-write that short
                  callback function like this using a more traditional anonymous
                  function declaration:

                  <pre><code class="lang-js">function(data) { return data; }</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  The callback on line 20 is similar...<code
                    >(item) => item.Id === id</code
                  >. Another way to write that could be:

                  <pre><code class="lang-js">function(item) { return item.Id === id; }</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    It is very common to see short functions that just return
                    some value or expression written using the arrow function
                    syntax.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  If you open up the <kbd>product.js</kbd> file you will see how
                  the <kbd>ProductData.mjs</kbd> module is used. First note that
                  we have to import it, then we can create an instance of our
                  class...
                  <pre><code class="lang-js">
import ProductData from './ProductData.js';
const dataSource = new ProductData('tents');
                        </code></pre>

                  <p class="callout">
                    Remember that to use ESModules in JavaScript we have to tell
                    the browser we want to use modules...we do that with
                    <code>type="module"</code> in the script tag in the HTML. If
                    you look at any of the HTML files in the
                    <kbd>product-pages</kbd> directory you will see that this
                    has already been added.
                  </p>

              </ol>

            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>URL Parameters</h3>
              <p>
                We need to have some way of passing in the product that we want
                to show the details for. A common way to do this is through a
                <a
                  href="https://www.sitepoint.com/get-url-parameters-with-javascript/"
                  target="_blank"
                  >URL Parameter</a
                >. If we create a link like this:
                <code
                  >&lt;a href="product_pages/index.html?product=880RR"
                  &gt;</code
                >. We have embedded the id of one of our products into the link.
                When the page loads it will have access to that information. If
                you read through that article it suggests the following lines of
                code to retrieve it:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">const queryString = window.location.search;
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString);
const product = urlParams.get('product')
            </code></pre>
              <p>
                Use those lines to create a new function in the
                <kbd>utils.mjs</kbd> file called
                <code>getParam(param)</code> that we can use to get a parameter
                from the URL when we need to. (Don't forget to return the
                parameter!)
              </p>

              <p>
                Import your new function into <kdb>product.js</kdb>. Open
                <kbd>/index.html</kbd> and change the link to the first product
                page from
                <code>href="product_pages/marmot-ajax-3.html"</code> to
                <code>href="product_pages/index.html?product=880RR"</code>.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                Where did the <code>880RR</code> come from? If you look in the
                <kbd>json/tents.json</kbd> file you will see that each record in
                there has an id. <code>880RR</code> is the id for the first
                tent!
              </p>
              <p>
                Then test your getParams function in <kbd>product.js</kbd> to
                see if you can get the product id successfully when someone
                navigates to the product-details page. This would be a good time
                to test out our <code>findProductById</code> method as well.
              </p>

              <p>
                You should also update the rest of the links in
                <kbd>/index.html</kbd> to match the first one. You can look up
                the IDs in the <kbd>tents.json</kbd> file.

                to the <kbd>ProductData.mjs</kbd> file by placing the public

                  <code>init()</code>: there are a few things that need to
                  happen before our class can be used. Some will happen in the
                  constructor and will happen automatically. Others it is nice
                  to have more control over and so we will place them into an
                  init method.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>addToCart()</code>: This is the function that is
                  currently in <kbd>product.js</kbd>. We need to move it here

                <li>
                  <code>renderProductDetails()</code>: method to generate the
                  HTML to display our product.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                It will be nice for our product to keep track of important
                information about itself. I would recommend something like this
                for your constructor method:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">constructor(productId, dataSource){
  this.productId = productId;
  this.product = {};
  this.dataSource = dataSource;
}</code></pre>
              <p>
                With that information the product will know which id it has, it
                will have a source to get the information it needs when the time
                comes, and will have a place to store the details we need to
                show once we retrieve them.
              </p>
              <p>
                To use our class we need to pull everything from the last few
                steps together in the <kbd>product.js</kbd> file. Once we get
                everything refactored that file should look something like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">import ProductData from './ProductData.js';
import ProductDetails from './ProductDetails.mjs';
import { setLocalStorage, getParam } from './utils.mjs';

const productId = getParam('product');
const dataSource = new ProductData('tents');

const product = new ProductDetails(productId, dataSource);
product.init();</code></pre>
              <p>
                Notice we import in the code we need from our modules. Then we
                get the id of our product using our helper function
                <code>getParams</code>. We create an instance of our
                <code>ProductData</code> data class with the URL it should use
                to look for products. Then we use both of those to create an
                instance of our <code>ProductDetails</code> class so that it has
                everything it needs to work. Finally we call our
                <code>init()</code> method using our class instance to finish
                setting everything up.
              </p>

                  <code>init()</code>: this function needs to do a few things,
                  copy/paste the following into your code to use as a guide for
                  finishing it:
                  <pre><code class="lang-js">async init() {
  // use our datasource to get the details for the current product. findProductById will return a promise! use await or .then() to process it
  // once we have the product details we can render out the HTML
  // once the HTML is rendered we can add a listener to Add to Cart button
  // Notice the .bind(this). Our callback will not work if we don't include that line. Review the readings from this week on 'this' to understand why.
  document.getElementById('addToCart')
          .addEventListener('click', this.addToCart.bind(this));

        <h2>Instructor's Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for at least one hour. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/vite-team2/src"
            target="_blank"

            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, reviewed the instructor's
          solution, and gotten your code working, the driver should commit and
          push their changes (don't forget to lint and format your code before
          committing!), then submit a pull request for this branch. Then review
          the pull request as a team, close it, and merge the branch back into
          Main. Finally, someone should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
