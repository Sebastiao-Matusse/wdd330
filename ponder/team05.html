        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Many of the changes we have already made were to prepare the site to
          be able to scale up to as many products as we would like. In this
          activity we will add products organized from 4 categories: Tents,
          Sleeping Bags, Backpacks, and Hammocks. We will need to change the
          index page to show our four categories, and then build a dynamic
          product-listing page that will pull the products from an API, and
          display them.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

        <div class="requirements">
          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team5: Expand inventory" task...then move it to 'Doing'. Read
                the details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                GitHub before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team5</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team5</code>
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Refactor</h3>
              <p>
                Create a new directory in <kbd>src</kbd> called
                <kbd>product-listing</kbd>, and create an HTML file in it. Also
                create a <kbd>product-listing.js</kbd> file in the JS directory.
                Add the HTML to our new page to get the foundation up...header,
                footer, styles, etc. (Hint...you may just want to use
                src/index.html as a starting point. Then remove the banner and
                text.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Move the JS from the <kbd>main.js</kbd> that is responsible to
                render our list of products to the new
                <kbd>product-listing.js</kbd> file. Open up
                <kbd>product-listing/index.html</kbd> in the browser to make
                sure the tents we had before are still rendered.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                You will need to fix some paths to get everything working
                correctly...your page will not be able to find the CSS file or
                the new JS file we made until you do. Do not worry about fixing
                the image URLs yet. Those will change again anyway and we will
                fix those later.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally add a grid of 4 boxes to the src/index.html page, one
                for each category. They should look something like this:
              </p>
              <div class="fig-block">
                <figure>
                  <img

                    alt="index product grid."

                Here are links to the icons. The icons are being used with a
                Creative Commons license so we need to give credit to the
                creator. We will do that in this case by adding it to the alt
                attribute:

              </ul>
              <p>
                Each of the category elements should link to
                <kbd>product-listing/index.html</kbd>. Make sure to pass the
                correct category as part of the URL. (tents, backpacks,
                sleeping-bags, hammocks).
              </p>
              <p>
                If you need a reminder of how to add a URL parameter to a link
                check out the <code>template</code> that is still up in the
                <code>head</code> of <kbd>src/index.html</kbd>. It has an
                example of passing a parameter. Oh and after you look at it you
                can remove that <code>template</code> element. We don't need it
                in this page (<kbd>src/index.html</kbd>) anymore since we will
                be building those in
                <kbd>product-listing/index.html</kbd>
              </p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>

              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Pulling from an API</h3>
              <p>
                Next we need to modify our code to pull the product data from an
                API instead of from the local JSON file. Because of the way we
                have structured our code this should be fairly easy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Open up <kbd>productData.js</kbd>. In the constructor we set a
                path for the products. That path was based off of the category
                (up until now tents) and would later be used to pull the data.
                With the API we actually don't need to set the category in our
                DataSource anymore. We can pass it in when we need it. This will
                make our DataSource more flexible. Add the following line to the
                top of the file:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">const baseURL = 'http://server-nodejs.cit.byui.edu:3000/'</code></pre>
              <p>
                Then remove the category and path from the constructor. Then in
                the <code>getData</code> method add a parameter of
                <code>category</code> and change the fetch command to look like
                this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">return fetch(baseURL + `products/search/${category}`)
                .then(convertToJson).then((data) => data.Result);</code></pre>
              <p class="callout">
                Why <code>data.Result</code> at the end of that? It used to be
                simply <code>data</code>. The data sent back from the API is
                structured differently. We will have some other corrections to
                make because of this as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Open <kbd>productList.js</kbd> We will need to change the line
                in the <code>init()</code> method where we get our data. It
                should look like this after our changes:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">const list = await this.dataSource.getData(this.category);</code></pre>
              <p>
                You should now be seeing products listed if you click on one of
                the links, but there are two issues. The first is that no images
                are showing. The second is that all the links are showing the
                same list of products.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Pulling the correct products</h3>
              <p>
                You should be passing category in the URL to the
                <kbd>product-listing</kbd> page. We need to retrieve it from the
                parameter in <kbd>product-listing.js</kbd>. Then send it into
                the <code>ProductList</code> class. Remember that we created a
                method in <kbd>utils.js</kbd> earlier to grab parameters from a
                URL.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                We have been moving a lot of things around. At this point your
                <kbd>product-list.js</kbd> file should look something like this:

                <pre><code class="lang-js">import ProductData from './productData.js';
import ProductList from './productList.js';
import { loadHeaderFooter, getParam } from './utils.js';

loadHeaderFooter();

const category = getParam('category');
// first create an instance of our ProductData class.
const dataSource = new ProductData();
// then get the element we want the product list to render in
const listElement = document.querySelector('.product-list');
// then create an instance of our ProductList class and send it the correct information.
const myList = new ProductList(category, dataSource, listElement);
// finally call the init method to show our products
myList.init();</code></pre>
              </div>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Fix the Product Detail page.</h3>
              <p>
                If you try and click on on of the products to see the
                details...you will notice it is broken. We will need to make
                some of the same changes to <kbd>product.js</kbd> and
                <kbd>productDetail.js</kbd> that we made for the product
                listing. Get the detail pages working again.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  There are a few places we need to check to do this. We should
                  make a list:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Because we moved the product listing page into a directory
                    the URL listed in the template for a product card in
                    <kbd>product-listing/index.html</kbd> will be wrong. That
                    needs to be fixed first.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We removed the requirement for the DataSource to be set to a
                    specific category, and we updated the
                    <code>getData</code> method. Now we need to fix the
                    <code>findProductById</code> method. We can query the API
                    directly for this. The URL for the API endpoint you need to
                    hit is:
                    <kbd>baseURL + `product/${id}`</kbd>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once you get it working you will find that the image is
                    broken. We need to figure out why. See below for more on
                    this.

                the images are broken. Analyze the data coming back from the API
                and figure out how to fix this issue. (You can use the
                <kbd>PrimaryMedium</kbd> image for the productList, and
                <kbd>PrimaryLarge</kbd> for the productDetail for now.)

        <h2>Instructor's Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
