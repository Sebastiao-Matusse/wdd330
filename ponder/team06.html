        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The next step for our site is to build out the checkout process.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

        <div class="requirements">
          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team6: Checkout" task...then move it to 'Doing'. Read the
                details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team6</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team6</code>
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>The Cart</h3>
              <p>
                Check your cart page to make sure that it is correctly
                displaying a total. If it is not then someone in your group
                should really complete that card in Trello. :)
              </p>
              <p>
                Add a <kbd>Checkout</kbd> button/link that will take us to the
                checkout page.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Checkout page</h3>
              <p>
                Next we need to build a form on the checkout page to gather the
                required information from our users. We will need the following:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Customer Name</li>
                <li>
                  Address (we will assume billing and shipping are the same)
                </li>
                <li>Credit card number, expiration date, and security code.</li>
                <li>Submit button</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The form should not submit unless all of the fields are filled
                out. You should also show an order summary on this page. An
                example of what this page could look like is below.
              </p>
              <div class="fig-block">
                <figure>
                  <img
                    src="../images/sleepoutside-checkout-form.png"
                    alt="checkout form."
                  />
                </figure>
              </div>
              <p>
                Notice that the last section is just displaying that
                information, but not in inputs. We need that information to be
                sent to the server, but we don't want the users to be able to
                edit that themselves! In the function that prepares the data to
                send to the server that we will write we will need to add those
                totals back in.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a real site the server should verify the totals as well to
                make sure that the user doesn't try anything funny.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Order summary</h3>
              <p>
                We need to fill in the information in the summary section. the
                Item Subtotal will come from the items in the cart, and then we
                need to add Tax and shipping costs and calculate the order
                total. Once the user supplies a zip code you should calculate
                both shipping and tax and display it in the order summary to the
                user.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Normally tax and shipping would be calculated according to the
                  destination address. There would be a look up process that
                  would figure out the right values to use. To keep ours simple
                  we will use the same formulas for all orders.
                </p>
                <dl>
                  <dt>Tax</dt>
                  <dd>Use 6% for sales tax.</dd>
                  <dt>Shipping</dt>
                  <dd>
                    Use $10 for the first item plus $2 for each additional item
                    for shipping.
                  </dd>
                </dl>
              </div>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Create a <kbd>CheckoutProcess</kbd> module, and add a method
                  to calculate and display the item subtotal. This should get
                  called when the page loads.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Then create a second method to calculate and display shipping,
                  tax, and order total. This method should get called after the
                  user fills in the Zip code.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <!-- END STEP -->

              <h3>Refactor ProductData</h3>
              <p>
                We will use the same server we used last week to pull the
                products from for submitting our orders, but a different
                endpoint. The URL should be:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">http://157.201.228.93:2992/checkout</code></pre>
              <p>
                Because we need to send the order information we will need to
                make a <kbd>POST</kbd> request to the server instead of the
                <kbd>GET</kbd> request we have been using.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are already making requests to this server for product data
                through our <kbd>ProductData</kbd> module. This would be the
                logical place to add the functionality to submit an order. The
                name "ProductData" becomes less descriptive of what is going on
                in the module now however. It would probably be better with the
                name <kbd>ExternalServices</kbd>. That is more descriptive.
                Refactor your code to make this change.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">

                  If you panicked a bit when you read that you are paying
                  attention. Renaming something that you have already used in
                  multiple places is not something to do lightly, but sometimes
                  it is necessary. Because of this good development tools will
                  have built in ways to help you. VS Code is a good tool.
                </p>
              </div>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Commit and push your changes before proceeding. That will make
                  it easy to revert if something goes wrong :)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Open <kbd>productData.js</kbd> and select the word
                  <code>ProductData</code> in the class definition. Right click
                  on it and select "Rename symbol" in the menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enter 'ExternalServices' and hold down the shift key while
                  hitting enter/return. This will preview the changes. It should
                  open up a new panel in the editor where it will show you
                  everywhere it found the name that you want to change. If you
                  left-click on one of the lines it will open the file side by
                  side with how it was before the changes and how it will be
                  after. Review each change. If the changes looks good then
                  right-click on the same line in the Preview panel and select
                  'apply Refactoring'. Then go File->Save All
                </li>
                <li>
                  Next we need to adjust the filename of the module so that it
                  reflects the change. If you right-click on the file in the
                  file explorer in VS Code and select rename there...you should
                  get a popup message that asks if you want to rename the
                  imports as well. Say yes! File->Save All again
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally just to make sure nothing was missed...on the side of
                  your VsCode window click on the magnifying glass icon
                  (ctrl/cmd + shift + F). Type <kbd>ProductData</kbd> and if
                  there are any more instances change them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Test the product list and product detail pages to make sure
                  they still work!
                </li>
              </ol>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Submit the order</h3>
              <p>
                Add a new method to our newly renamed
                <kbd>ExternalServices</kbd> class. Call it <kbd>checkout</kbd>.
                It should accept an object that represents our order. The object
                should look like the following (order does not matter):
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">{

  shipping: 12,
  tax: "16.20"
}</code></pre>
              <p>
                Use <kbd>1234123412341234</kbd> for the card number,
                <kbd>123</kbd> for the security code, and any expiration in the
                future if you want your order to succeed.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                For testing to save you time and typing remember that you can
                set the <code>value=""</code> property of an html input
                element...just remember to remove your defaults once everything
                is working.
              </p>
              <p>
                The method should POST that object You will need to create a
                custom options object and pass it in with your fetch. (remember
                to stringify your object before sending it!) to the address
                above (http://157.201.228.93:2992/checkout) and return the
                server response. The response will be JSON.

              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  All of the requests we have made this far have been fairly
                  simple and the default settings for fetch have been
                  sufficient. The defaults will not work for us here. Fetch has
                  an optional second argument that is for options. An options
                  object that will work for use here is below:
                </p>
                <pre><code class="lang-js">const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload)
}</code></pre>
                <p>We would use it like this:</p>
                <pre><code class="lang-js">fetch(url, options);</code></pre>
              </div>
              <p>
                You will also need to add a method in
                <kbd>CheckoutProcess</kbd> that will get called when the
                checkout button is clicked. It should prepare the order data
                object, and then call ExternalServices.checkout.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  When you attach the listener to the checkout button you will
                  probably want to keep the form from doing what it would
                  normally do on submit. You can do this by calling
                  <code>event.preventDefault()</code> in the listener function.

                response from your POST to the server. Next week the team
                activity will continue this by handling the success and failure
                responses appropriately.

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/team6/src"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, and reviewed the instructor's
          solution, the driver should commit and push their changes, then submit
          a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a
          team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally someone
          should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
