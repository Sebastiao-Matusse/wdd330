        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The next step for our site is to build out the checkout process.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

        <div class="requirements">
          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team6: Checkout" task...then move it to 'Doing'. Read the
                details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team6</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team6</code>
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>The Cart</h3>
              <p>
                Check your cart page to make sure that it is correctly
                displaying a total. If it is not then you need to add the code
                to do that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then add a <kbd>Checkout</kbd> button/link that will take us to
                the checkout page.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Checkout page</h3>
              <p>
                Next we need to build a form on the checkout page to gather the
                required information from our users. We will need the following:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Customer Name</li>
                <li>
                  Address (we will assume billing and shipping are the same)
                </li>
                <li>Credit card number, expiration date, and security code.</li>
                <li>Submit button</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The form should not submit unless all of the fields are filled
                out. You should also show an order summary on this page. An
                example of what this page could look like is below.
              </p>
              <div class="fig-block">
                <figure>
                  <img
                    src="../images/product-categories-grid.png"
                    alt="index product grid."
                  />
                </figure>
              </div>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Calculating Tax and shipping</h3>
              <p>
                We need to add Tax and shipping costs to the order total. Once
                the user supplies a zip code you should calculate both shipping
                and tax and display it in the order summary to the user.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Normally tax and shipping would be calculated according to the
                  destination address. There would be a look up process that
                  would figure out the right values to use. To keep ours simple
                  we will use the same formulas for all orders.
                </p>
                <dl>
                  <dt>Tax</dt>
                  <dd>Use 6% for sales tax.</dd>
                  <dt>Shipping</dt>
                  <dd>
                    Use $10 for the first item plus $2 for each additional item
                    for shipping.
                  </dd>
                </dl>
              </div>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Refactor ProductData</h3>
              <p>
                We will use the same server we used last week to pull the
                products from for submitting our orders, but a different
                endpoint. The URL should be:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">http://157.201.228.93:2992/checkout</code></pre>
              <p>
                Because we need to send the order information we will need to
                make a <kbd>POST</kbd> request to the server instead of the
                <kbd>GET</kbd> request we have been using.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are already making requests to this server for product data
                through our <kbd>ProductData</kbd> module. This would be the
                logical place to add the functionality to submit an order. The
                name "ProductData" becomes less descriptive of what is going on
                in the module now however. It would probably be better with the
                name <kbd>ExternalServices</kbd>. That is more descriptive.
                Refactor your code to make this change.
              </p>
              <div class="callout">

                  If you panicked a bit when you read that you are paying
                  attention. Renaming something that you have already used in
                  multiple places is not something to do lightly, but sometimes
                  it is necessary. Because of this good development tools will
                  have built in ways to help you. VS Code is a good tool.
                </p>
              </div>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Commit and push your changes before proceeding. That will make
                  it easy to revert if something goes wrong :)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Open <kbd>productData.js</kbd> and select the word
                  <code>ProductData</code> in the class definition. Right click
                  on it and select "Rename symbol" in the menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enter 'ExternalServices' and hold down the shift key while
                  hitting enter/return. This will preview the changes. It should
                  open up a new panel in the editor where it will show you
                  everywhere it found the name that you want to change. If you
                  left-click on one of the lines it will open the file side by
                  side with how it was before the changes and how it will be
                  after. If the change looks good then right-click on the same
                  line in the Preview panel and select 'apply Refactoring'.
                  Review each change and apply it after making sure it looks
                  good.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finally we need to adjust the filename of the module so that
                  it reflects the change.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Test the product list and product detail pages to make sure
                  they still work!
                </li>
              </ol>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Submit the order</h3>
              <p>
                Add a new method to our newly renamed
                <kbd>ExternalServices</kbd> class. Call it <kbd>checkout</kbd>.
                It should accept an object that represents our order. The object
                should look like the following:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">{ orderDate: '2021-1-10',
orderTotal: 116,
shipping: 10,
tax: 6,
items: [
    { description: ""}                    
] </code></pre>
              <p>
                The method should POST that object to the address above
                (http://157.201.228.93:2992/checkout) and return the server
                response. The response will be JSON.
              </p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>

          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Handle the order response</h3>
              <p>
                Once the order is submitted to the server it will respond with a
                success or an error. The application should give feedback to the
                user based on which result was sent back.
              </p>
              <p>
                On success you should give the user a message indicating that,
                and clear out the cart.
              </p>
              <p>On error let them know something went wrong.</p>

              <!-- END STEP -->

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/team5/src"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, and reviewed the instructor's
          solution, the driver should commit and push their changes, then submit
          a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a
          team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally someone
          should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
