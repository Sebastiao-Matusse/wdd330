        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Now that our users can places orders...we need to create a way for our
          staff to review and process those orders. This week we will add a
          simple Administrative portion of our site. This portion of the site
          should only be accessed by authenticated users.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                The driver should visit the team's copy of the Trello board for
                the project. Add each of the attending team members to the
                "Team8: Authentication" task...then move it to 'Doing'. Read the
                details of the card together.
              </p>
              <p>
                The driver should make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from
                Github before proceeding. Next they should create a new branch
                called <kbd>initials--team8</kbd>. So if the driver's name were
                John Doe the branch should be called <code>jd--team8</code>
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Setup our Admin page</h3>
              <p>
                Create a new directory in the src directory called
                <kbd>admin</kbd>. Add an <kbd>index.html</kbd> and add the basic
                HTML we need as well as add the header and footer of the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create an <kbd>Admin.js</kbd> module as well. Add a class and
                two initial methods: <code>login</code>, and
                <code>showLogin</code>
              </p>
              <p>
                Finish writing the <code>showLogin</code> method. It should
                build a login form in the <code>main</code> element of our page.
                The form should include a box for email, password, and a submit
                button. When the button is clicked it should call the
                <code>login</code> method.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Logging in</h3>
              <p>
                Next we need to finish our <code>login</code> method. The server
                that we need to authenticate with to retrieve the orders
                information has a login endpoint at this address:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">http://157.201.228.93:2992/login</code></pre>
              <p>
                We need to make a <code>POST</code> request to that address with
                the email and password the user provides as the body.
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">{ email: "user1@email.com" , password: "user1" }</code></pre>
              <p>
                If our request is successful (email and password match a user in
                the database) then the server will return a token. This token
                must be provided with each additional request we make so the
                server. Save it as a property of the Admin class.
              </p>
              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Getting the orders</h3>
              <p>The orders we are looking for can be found at</p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">http://157.201.228.93:2992/orders</code></pre>
              <p>
                If you make a <code>GET</code> request to that address however
                you will get an error. This is a protected endpoint. We need to
                send our token along with our request so that the server knows
                we can be trusted. Tokens like this are usually included in the
                <kbd>headers</kbd> of the request.
              </p>
              <p>
                Add a header for our request called
                <code>Authorization</code> that will include our token. If you
                look in <kbd>ExternalServices->checkout</kbd> there is an
                example of using a custom header. If you decide to copy/paste
                that one, remember that we want to do a GET, which means we
                shouldn't have a <code>body</code> property.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will probably want to make a new method in
                <kbd>ExternalServices</kbd> to get the orders, The line you will
                want to add to the <code>headers</code> portion of your options
                should look like this:
              </p>
              <pre><code class="lang-js">headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
} </code></pre>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>

          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <h3>Display the orders</h3>
              <p>
                Write the code necessary to display the list of orders to the
                user.
              </p>
              <p class="callout">
                'That's not very detailed instructions' you may be saying to
                yourself...you are right! You shouldn't need detailed
                instructions for this part at this point :) Keep usability in
                mind when you do this however, and make it look good. Also...you
                probably do not want to display all of the information in the
                order. Put yourself in the shoes of someone needing to review
                and process these orders to fill them. What information would
                YOU like to see?
              </p>

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/matkat99/sleepoutside/tree/team8/src"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >click here for the instructor's solution</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
        <p>
          After you have completed what you can, and reviewed the instructor's
          solution, the driver should commit and push their changes, then submit
          a pull request for this branch. Then review the pull request as a
          team, close it, and merge the branch back into Main. Finally someone
          should move the Trello card to "Done".
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
