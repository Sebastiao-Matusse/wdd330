          Each team should have made a copy of this
          <a href="https://trello.com/b/LO93bmJy/sleepoutside" target="_blank"
            >Trello board</a
          >. This is a shared board that you will all be working from over the
          semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some tasks marked "Team" and others that are not. Each week
          the team should complete the appropriate team activity together. The
          goal is then to complete one additional card per team member per week.
          These should be done individually as much as possible, but remember
          that you have a team to help you if you get stuck on a particular
          task.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to demonstrate how this should work it is recommended that
          each member of the team complete the same card for this first time.
          <strong
            >After this week each member should complete different cards</strong
          >.

          Begin with the "Add item to cart broken" task. This is largely a
          debugging and troubleshooting task, but it will help you to become
          familiar with the code we were given.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol class="bigSteps">
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <p>
              Visit the team's copy of the Trello board for the project. Add
              yourself to the "Add item to cart broken" task...then move it to
              "Doing" (if the card is already in "Doing" then just add
              yourself). Read the details of the card.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make sure to <kbd>pull</kbd> any changes from GitHub before
              proceeding. Next create a new branch called
              <kbd>initials--add cart broken</kbd>. So if the name name were
              John Doe the branch should be called
              <code>jd--add cart broken</code>
            </p>

            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <p>
              Spend some time looking through the code. Start the development
              environment up (<kbd>npm run start</kbd>). Try adding an item to
              the cart. Notice that nothing seems to happen. Open the browser
              developer tools and check there.
            </p>
            <p class="callout">
              The code stores the cart contents inside localStorage. This is a
              place in the browser where a website can keep things. LocalStorage
              works like cookies, in that it will persist until a user clears
              their browser cache, but you can store more information there. To
              see what is currently stored in your browser's localStorage go to
              the Application tab if you are in Chrome dev tools. Then on the
              side select "Local Storage->http://127.0.0.1". Notice there should
              be something there...you can clear out the contents of the storage
              from here as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Try adding another item to the cart. Note what happens in
              localStorage.
            </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Pay careful attention to the error in the console, but be
                  aware that where the error is caught is not always where the
                  problem is.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Remember that you can set breakpoints to stop your code and
                  inspect it. Do this. (Sources tab, open a JS file. Click on
                  the line number where you want the breakpoint.) It is also a
                  good way to figure out how everything is put together.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As you poke around you will hopefully find the function
                  <code>addToCart</code>. Pay attention to what it is doing.
                  What does <code>setLocalStorage</code> do?
                </li>
              </ul>

            <h2>Make a pull request.</h2>
            <p>
              After you have completed the card and have things working, you
              should commit and push your changes (don't forget to lint and
              format your code before committing!), then submit a pull request
              for this branch.
            </p>
            <p>
              Normally your pull request would get reviewed by another member of
              the team and merged back into main, in this case however we have
              more than one branch that has solved the same problem. We only
              want to merge <strong>ONE</strong> of those branches back into
              main. Discuss with your team which branch you want to keep and
              have one of the team merge that pull request. The other requests
              can be closed without merging. Finally someone should move the
              Trello card to "Done".
            </p>
            <p>
              From here on you should follow this process with each of the
              Trello tasks you complete:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Choose a Trello card, assign yourself to it, and move to "Doing"
              </li>
              <li>Make a branch</li>
              <li>Complete the work</li>
              <li>Lint and format</li>
              <li>Commit and push</li>
              <li>Move the Trello card to "Done"</li>
              <li>Make a pull request for your branch</li>
              <li>Let your group know there is a pull request waiting</li>
              <li>
                Another team member should review the pull request in GitHub
                and, if everything looks good, Merge the request. I would also
                recommend deleting the old branch as part of that process as
                well.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
