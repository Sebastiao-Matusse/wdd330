        <h1>Trello Sprint 2</h1>
        <hr />

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          As we move into the next sprint of the project, some new requirements have been added. Your team should add these as cards to your Trello board and complete them over the next three lessons (1.5 weeks). Each team should plan on completing the Team card plus at least one card per person per lesson (two each week).
        </p>

        <h2>Changes and additions</h2>

        <dl>
            <dt>Product search</dt>
            <dd>Add a search box to the navbar that will allow you to search for a product. When the form submits, the search results should be retrieved from the API and displayed on a product list page.</dd>
            <dt>Product list sort</dt>
            <dd>On the product list page, add the ability to sort by name or price.</dd>
            <dt>Duplicate items in cart</dt>
            <dd>Currently our addToCart method does not check to see if an item is already in the cart before adding it again. Make this check...if the item is in the cart do not add it again.</dd>
            <dt>Correct image size</dt>
            <dd>Right now our pages show the same sized product image for all browser window sizes. Change the image shown based on the screen width.</dd>
            <dt>Sale flag</dt>
            <dd>Add a visual indicator of how much a product is discounted to the product listing page.</dd>
            <dt>Cart quantities</dt>
            <dd>Add the ability to change the quantity of a product desired in the cart.</dd>
            <dt>Breadcrumbs</dt>
            <dd>Right below the navbar add a breadcrumb that will indicate where the user is in the site. On the home page it will not show. On the product list it will show "Product Category->(#products)" (so if you were looking at Tents it would be "Tents->(24 items)".  If you were looking at a product it would show "Product category"</dd>
            <dt>Call to actionâ€”register with site</dt>
            <dd>The first time a visitor comes to the site it should show them a banner or modal that encourages them to register with the site, and gives details about a giveaway for those who register.</dd>
            <dt>Quick lookup</dt>
            <dd>On the product listing page, add a quick view button. When clicked, it should show a modal with the product details in it.</dd>
          <dt>Discount flag on product detail</dt>
          <dd>Add a flag on the product detail page indicating the amount the product is discounted.</dd>
          <dt>Newsletter sign up.</dt>
          <dd>Add a box on the home page that would allow a user to sign up to receive a Newsletter.</dd>
          <dt>Team 4: Dynamic header and footer</dt>
          <dd>As we move forward, the site would benefit greatly from dynamic generation of any pages dealing with products. We began this process last week. Now we should finish by addressing the product listing page, as well as allowing for the templating of the header and footer.</dd>
          <dt>Team 5: Expand inventory</dt>
          <dd>With the changes we have made, we are ready to expand our inventory into 4 categories: Tents, Backpacks, Sleeping Bags, and Hammocks.
            The products can be accessed through a couple of API endpoints.
            /products/search/{search term} and /product/id.
            The main index page should be updated to show the four categories. Clicking on one should take you to a new product listing page for the appropriate category.
        <div><img src="../images/product-categories-grid.png"></div></dd>
        <dt>Team 6: Checkout</dt>
        <dd>Add a button to the cart page to take the user to a checkout form. Add the form to gather the required info (see the team activity instructions in I-Learn) calculate the shipping, tax, and order total, then submit the order to the server.</dd>
