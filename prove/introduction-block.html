        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Very few applications are written by one developer. Almost all are
          built by a team, or multiple teams. There are two major branches of
          web development currently: Frontend development and Backend
          development. This course (WDD 330) As the name would indicate focuses
          on the frontend. This is code that runs in the browser. Essentially
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Backend development involves code that runs on a server. There are
          many different languages that can be used. Here at BYUI we have
          courses in the following backend languages: PHP, NodeJS, .NET, Python,
          and Java. Two of these: CSE 340 and CSE 341 reflect well the two major
          approaches to the backend currently:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            CSE 340 approaches it from a monolithic standpoint. Most of the
            business logic runs on the server, the HTML is generated by the
            server and sent to the browser. Any JavaScript will be to add
            interactivity. This is often called Server Side Rendering (SSR)
          </li>
          <li>
            CSE 341 uses a more client oriented approach. The backend is used
            for data persistence, authentication, and other similar things.
            These are exposed as API endpoints or services. The Frontend
            contains most of the business logic and will retrieve data from the
            backend, then generate the HTML necessary to display it. This is
            called Client Side Rendering (CSR)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This course uses the second approach (client side).</p>
        <h2>The Team Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          For the final challenge of this course your team will need to work
          together to design and build a frontend web application of your
          choice. For this week you will have the following tasks:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Brainstorm a list of application ideas that sound interesting
            (5-10).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As you are brainstorming start with the interests of the team members.
          Building an application about something you are familiar with (and
          enjoy!) will be easier and more fun than something you are not
          interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are not required to select one idea at this point (though that
          will need to be done by Week 4), but if there is one that really
          stands not and the team is excited about go ahead and indicate that it
          will likely be your choice. Submit the list of ideas in this activity.
        </p>
