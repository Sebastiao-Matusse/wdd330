        <h1>Team Challenge Proposal</h1>
        <hr />

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          By now your team should have settled on one idea for your project.
          This week a more detailed project proposal will be required.
        </p>

        <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <p>
          Your proposal can take many forms, but should show that you have
          thought through your idea enough to understand what will be required
          and that the complexity matches the time available. It should also
          show how it will meet the following project requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Includes authentication and user management</li>
          <li>Performs GET/POST/PUT/DELETE against the backend API</li>
          <li>All exposed features should work 100%</li>
          <li>
            Should be a combination of static and dynamically generated Markup.
          </li>
          <li>Should incorporate animation</li>
          <li>
            Code should show a good level of organization (ESmodules, classes,
            etc)
          </li>
          <li>Code should be error free (according to team ESLint rules)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below is a list of required sections for you proposal</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            An Overview of the idea. Why are we doing this? What is the problem
            we are trying to solve?
          </li>
          <li>Who is the audience?</li>
          <li>
            List of the major functions of the application. What will it do?
            List these in as much detail as you can.
          </li>
          <li>Wireframes of the major views</li>
          <li>
            Link to a Trello board with all the tasks you can think of at this
            point defined as cards. Again be as detailed as possible here.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For the Trello board you can choose to have it be just for the
          frontend related tasks, or include the backend tasks as well. The
          Trello board is also a living document. It won't be done when you turn
          it in...and will certainly change. Still, being as thorough as you can
          here will make sure that you have thought this thing through :)
        </p>
        <p>Submit your proposal.</p>
