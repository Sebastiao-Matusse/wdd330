        <h1>Managing the Modern Frontend Workflow</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          Development workflow has become quite complicated for Web development.
          Let's take a medium-sized project for example. It could have dozens of
          JavaScript files, several CSS files, 3rd party libraries, and who
          knows how many icons, fonts, images, etc. involved. It might be
          using a CSS preprocessor like SASS or it could be transpiling the
          JavaScript to make sure that new features will work in older browsers.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p>
            Here is a potential list of tasks that could need to happen every time
            something changes:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Lint CSS and JavaScript to find any coding issues.</li>
            <li>
              Run unit tests to make sure nothing got broken with your last
              changes
            </li>
            <li>Compile all SCSS/LESS to CSS</li>
            <li>Concatenate all CSS into one file for faster loading</li>
            <li>Minify the CSS to reduce file size</li>
            <li>Transpile JavaScript with Babel for wider support for older
              browsers</li>
            <li>Concatenate all JS files into one file for faster loading</li>
            <li>Minify and Uglify JavaScript to reduce size</li>
            <li>Do the same for any 3rd party CSS or JS</li>
            <li>Move all the production assets into a distribution directory to
              separate them from the development stuff</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Whew! That's a big list...and they have to happen A LOT!</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          It's no wonder that developers have produced tools to help manage all
          of this. This activity will introduce a simple implementation of some
          of these tools. The tools fall into three categories:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Package managers:</strong> These keep track of all of the external
            dependencies for our app. This includes development tools and libraries we
            might be using. It not only knows which packages to download, but it
            tracks versions as well. We are using <code>npm</code> for our
            package manager.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bundlers:</strong> Bundlers handle the compiling, transpiling, concatenating,
            minifying, and moving around of assets in our project. We are using
            <code>Snowpack</code> as our bundler. Other common bundlers are
            Parcel and Webpack.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Task managers:</strong> These keep track of what needs to be done and when.
            There will generally be scripts defined in the task manager for each
            phase of development. Our project is fairly simple so we are just
            using <code>npm</code> again for task manager. Other common managers
            are Grunt or Gulp.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We will be using a NPM/Node-based workflow for this course this
          semester. It is important that you understand how these tools work
          together. The Team Activity 1 will walk your group through setting
          this workflow up.
