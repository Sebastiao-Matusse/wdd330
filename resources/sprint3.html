        <hr />

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          As we move into the next sprint of the project some new requirements have been added. Your team should add these as cards to your Trello board and complete them over the next three weeks. Each team should plan on completing the Team card plus at least one card per person per week.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes and additions</h2>

        <dl>
            <dt>Product colors</dt>
            <dd>If a product has more than one color option...display all the colors with the swatch image. </dd>
            <dt>Product image carousel</dt>
            <dd>If there are ExtraImages in the data for a product, the product image on the product details page should be changed to a carousel and all images should be shown as options.</dd>
            <dt>Sign up process</dt>
            <dd>Create a sign up process for customers to be able to create a login for the site. Capture name, address, email. Stretch: add an avatar.  (post to /users to create user.)</dd>
            <dt>Wish List</dt>
            <dd>Add a wish list to the site. there are two ways you could go about this. One you could add an item to cart...and in the cart have the option to move something on and off of the wish list. Or two you could add a Wishlist button to the product details page. It should be easy to move stuff from the wish list into the cart to buy. If you have the create user card done then the wish list should be user specific. If you have not done the users card then wish list will be shown for anyone using the browser.</dd>
            <dt>Comments</dt>
            <dd>Add a comments subsystem. Customers should be able to add a comment to any product, all comments for that product should be displayed on the product detail page (post or get to /comments) </dd>
            
          <dt>Team 7: Error handling and Validation</dt>
          <dd>Checkout should be working, but there is currently no validation and limited error checking. Add validation to the form to help reduce problems, and add error checking. We also need to add some messaging to the user for success and failure on checkout.</dd>
          <dt>Team 8: Authentication</dt>
          <dd>Our application needs to give access to certain users to allow the review and processing of orders as they come in. This page should be protected by a login. Create a login page that will ask for an email and password. Submit those to the server. If they are valid the server will send a token back that we can use to request the orders.
           </dd>
