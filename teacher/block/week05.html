        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>L09 Midweek</h3>
        <p>
          The individual activity for this lesson will have the students create
          a simple Administrative section of the site that will require
          authentication to access. This is the last activity of working with
          the SleepOutside project.
        </p>
        <h3>L10 End-of-Week</h3>
        <p>
          Remind students that in the second half of this week they will begin
          working with their teams on their final project.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>
        <h3>L09 Midweek</h3>
        <p>
          The readings introduced several of the HTML APIs and Canvas. It could
          be fun to model several of those. (Quakes demo?)
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are feeling adventurous and the students are up for it you
          could run through a simple Canvas based game engine. Lots of good
          advanced practices in here. This is based off of chapter 3 in
          <a
            href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/html5-games-novice-to-ninja/read/3"

            rel="noreferrer"
            >HTML5 Games: Novice to Ninja</a
          >. The book demonstrates a lot of good coding practices as it walks
          you through building a game engine. I would recommend approaching it
          like this:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start by having the class download the
            <a href="../../examples/game.zip">code</a>
            (http://byui-cit.github.io/wdd330/examples/game.zip). A big part of
            this exercise...and the reason we are giving them so much code to
            start with...is to practice reviewing someone else's code to figure
            out how it works.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start in <kbd>main.js</kbd>. Point out the import...and the line
            below it. This is not how we have generally imported things. Open
            <kbd>index.js</kbd>. Talk about what is going on as well as the
            destructuring {} happening on line 14.
          </li>
          <li>
            Move on to the next lines...we create an instance of the
            <code>CanvasRenderer</code> class. Open that file and look at the
            constructor. The code there should feel comfortable to the students.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next is the <code>KeyControls</code> module. Open it up and talk
            about what it is doing. It uses getters which they may not have seen
            before.
          </li>
          <li>
            I would probably move down to the game loop next. Mention that
            <code>setInterval</code> is one way to schedule something to happen
            on a regular basis, but it has a few drawbacks...mainly it will
            continue running in the background!
            <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is generally considered a better
            choice. It runs on each new frame in the browser...60 / second.
          </li>
          <li>
            The first few lines in there are to even out high performing and low
            performing devices. We find how much time has passed since the loop
            last ran, and then we can use that to figure out how much to move
            things instead of just moving everything a fixed amount each time
            through the loop. In a perfect system, using a fixed amount would
            work fine because every computer would run the loop exactly 60 times
            per second, and each loop would take the exact amount of time...but
            reality is that there will be differences, and some computers will
            run some of the loops slower than others.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next move to the bottom of the loop and look at the canvas stuff.
            <code>cxt.save()</code> saves the settings of the context, so we can
            make changes in the font, color, position of the canvas coordinate
            system, etc. and as soon as we call
            <code>cxt.restore()</code> everything we changed will revert back to
            the last save.
          </li>
          <li>
            Talk about what needs to happen in general in a game loop: get user
            input, move everything a bit, check for collisions, update. Let's
            try updating our message. Uncomment the update call, and look at the
            update function defined above. Note how you are using the DT (delta
            time) to figure out how far to move the element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next open up the Container module and talk about it. Pay special
            attention to the update method. Notice it will loop through all the
            children and call their personal update if it exists. Note also the
            use of <code>filter</code>. We are using it to remove children when
            they are done (dead). Add an instance to main called
            <kbd>scene</kbd>, then use the <code>add</code> method to add our
            message to the container. Remove the call to message.update in the
            game loop and instead call scene.update().
          </li>
          <li>
            Then open up the CanvasRenderer and look at the render method. Note
            that it uses recursion! Note also that it has a case to render a
            Text asset. The code is very similar to what we had in the game
            loop. We can remove the code in the game loop, and replace it with
            <code>renderer.render(scene)</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a second text asset called <kbd>ship</kbd> to show how easy it
            is to add additional game assets. Set the text property to something
            like <kbd>&gt;()&gt;</kbd> or you could use an emoji: ðŸš€
          </li>
          <li>
            Movement: We need an update method added to our ship. It should
            check to see if any keys are currently pressed, and move the ship
            accordingly. We should also check to make sure the ship does not
            move outside of the canvas.
            <pre><code class="lang-js">const ship = new Text("ðŸš€", {
  font: "30pt sans-serif",
  fill: "DarkRed",
  align: "center"
});
ship.pos.x = w / 2;
ship.pos.y = h / 2;
ship.update = function (dt) {
  const { pos } = this;
  pos.x += controls.x * dt * 200;
  pos.y += controls.y * dt * 200;

  // Confine player to the screen
  if (pos.x < 0) pos.x = 0;
  if (pos.x > w) pos.x = w;
  if (pos.y < 0) pos.y = 0;
  if (pos.y > h) pos.y = h;
};</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Bullets! Create another container called bullets. We will also need
            to have a function to create a bullet. It could look something like
            this:
            <pre><code class="lang-js">// bullets
const bullets = new Container();
function fireBullet(x, y) {
  const bullet = new Text("-", {
    font: "30pt sans-serif",
    fill: "Green",
    align: "center"
  });
  bullet.pos.x = x;
  bullet.pos.y = y;
  bullet.update = function (dt) {
    this.pos.x += 400 * dt;
  };
  bullets.add(bullet);
  // Destroy bullets when they go out of the screen
  bullets.children = bullets.children.filter((bullet) => {
    return bullet.pos.x < w + 20;
  });
}</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            We will call our <code>fireBullet</code> function from the game
            loop. We don't want to let the user fire 60 bullets/second
            however...so we should check to see how long it has been, and after
            a certain amount of time we allow the creation of another bullet:
            <pre><code class="lang-js">// game state
let lastShot = 0;
//game loop
function loopy(ms) {
  requestAnimationFrame(loopy);
  const t = ms / 1000;
  dt = t - last;
  last = t;
  // fire bullet. controls.action will return true if the action key (spacebar) is currently pressed
  if (controls.action && t - lastShot > 0.15) {
    lastShot = t;
    fireBullet(ship.pos.x + 24, ship.pos.y);
  }
...</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            You are probably out of time by now...but if not the next step would
            be to add some bad guys. Another container would be perfect.
            <pre><code class="lang-js">// baddies
const baddies = new Container();
function spawnBaddie(x, y, speed) {
  const baddie = new Text("ðŸ‘¾", {
    font: "20pt sans-serif",
    fill: "Blue",
    align: "center"
  });
  baddie.pos.x = x;
  baddie.pos.y = y;
  baddie.update = function (dt) {
    this.pos.x += speed * dt;
  };
  baddies.add(baddie);
}
scene.add(baddies);</code></pre>
            <pre><code class="lang-js">// game state
let lastShot = 0;
let lastSpawn = 0;
let spawnSpeed = 1.0;

//game loop
function loopy(ms) {
  requestAnimationFrame(loopy);
  const t = ms / 1000;
  dt = t - last;
  last = t;

  if (controls.action && t - lastShot > 0.15) {
    lastShot = t;
    fireBullet(ship.pos.x + 24, ship.pos.y);
  }
  // Spawn bad guys
  if (t - lastSpawn > spawnSpeed) {
    lastSpawn = t;
    // multiplying two small numbers will give us a smaller number...it keeps the speed from getting too fast :)
    const speed = -50 - Math.random() * Math.random() * 100;
    const position = Math.random() * (h - 24);
    spawnBaddie(w, position, speed);
    // Accelerating for the next spawn
    spawnSpeed = spawnSpeed < 0.05 ? 0.6 : spawnSpeed * 0.97 + 0.001;
  }

  //move a bit
  scene.update(dt, t);

  renderer.render(scene);
}</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            A final challenge you might extend...have them open up the
            <kbd>main-completed.js</kbd> file and see if they can follow the
            code and figure out how it all works.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>L10 End-of-Week</h3>
        <p>You could use part of your meeting for questions on projects.</p>
        <p>
          This could be a great opportunity to talk about trying to make sense
          of API documentation. Also discuss using the
          <kbd>.gitignore</kbd> file to protect things like API keys.
