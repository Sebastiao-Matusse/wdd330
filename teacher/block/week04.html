        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>L07 Midweek</h3>
        <p>
          The individual activity for this lesson asks the students to finish
          the checkout process. They will need to create a checkout form, then
          submit the correct information to a server. The server lives at
          <a href="http://157.201.228.93:2992/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://157.201.228.93:2992/</a
          >. Check to make sure it is up!
        </p>
        <h3>L08 End-of-Week</h3>
        <p>
          The team activity for this lesson is a continuation of the last
          activity. The students should have successfully submitted an order to
          the server, but we did not handle the response, or deal with
          validation to make sure the user gives us good information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reading for this lesson introduces JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The
          individual activity in the next lesson will address authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remind the students that their project proposals are due this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students to record their questions while reading and
          give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>
        <h3>L07 Midweek</h3>
        <p>
          The reading for this lesson introduces CSS transitions and animations.
          As an example, I often use
          <a
            href="https://codepen.io/matkat/pen/EKaNZg"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >these boxes</a
          >
          to start and will change them (transform, size, shape, color,
          location) with transitions to demo the basics. I'll finish with a
          bouncing ball or make a box go around the content div (slide corner to
          corner all the way around). Then you might build something like this:
          <a href="../examples/poke-animation/poketest.html" target="_blank"
            >PokeApi Demo with animation</a
          >
          to review Ajax and add the sliding transition effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by coming up with the list of steps we might follow to solve the
          problem. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
  /*
  create an element with a list to hold the names of the Pokemon
  create a container to hold the details of the Pokemon
  place the containers side by side, make them each the size of the screen
  hide the details element (overflow:hidden on main)

  get the list of Pokemon
  display the list of Pokemon in the list element
      make sure to include the URL for the Pokemon details in the HTML
  attach a listener to the Pokemon list when clicked:
      get the details for the correct Pokemon
      insert the details into the details element
      slide the list and the details elements left 100vw
  Add a back button to the details element.
  attach a listener to the button, when clicked:
      slide list and details 100vw right
*/
        </pre>
        <h3>L08 End-of-Week</h3>
        <p>
          For your meeting it might be helpful to grab a Trello card from the
          SleepOutside project and work on it together with the students. Model
          especially the planning phase as students often struggle getting
          started. The cards for Trello Sprint 3 are more complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you could model requesting a token with a
          username/password and using it in requests.
