        <h2>Overview</h2>
		<h3>L01 Midweek</h3>
        <p>
          This lesson is all about foundation. All of the tools we will be using
          will be introduced, along with ideas about workflow in modern frontend
          development. Time can also be spent on reviewing the JavaScript
          concepts from the syllabus that the students are expected to know.
          There is no team activity for this lesson.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure students understand the grading structure. 30% comes
          from reading and team/individual activities. 70% from self-evaluation and
          portfolio. The self-evaluation will happen at the end of the semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          Explain the way the course will work. They will be working in groups
          through the whole semester. Those groups need to be formed by midweek.
          2-3 per group ideally. At midweek, <strong>ensure that each student has self-enrolled in a team activity group and that each group has 2-3 students.</strong> They have been instructed to reach out to you if they have scheduling conflicts. Adjust and/or create groups as needed to put together students who have the same time availability.
		</p>
		<p>
		  You might talk about some of the ideas in the
          <a
            href="https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/working-with-groups.html"
            target="_blank"
            >Working with Groups</a
          >
          document. The first 9 lessons (4.5 weeks) will be spent modeling what a typical web
          frontend project might look like. They will work together to build a
          simple ecommerce site. Some will be done all together in a peer
          programming model. Other parts will be done individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last part of the course will be spent working as teams to design and build a frontend application of
          the students' choosing.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a high emphasis on working effectively as a team in the
          course. Using tools like linters, bundlers, and GitHub are also
          stressed. The students will be expected to branch, pull request and
          merge with their projects. You may choose to spend some time talking
          about that in this lesson as well.
        </p>
		<h3>L02 End-of-Week</h3>
		<p>
          The first team activity happens during this lesson. There will be one during most weeks. Groups should have been formed by midweek. 
		</p>
		<p>
		  The team activities are intended to be done in peer programming style. For
          online you might suggest something like multiplayer in
          <a href="https://repl.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >repl.it</a
          >
          to code together, or screen sharing in Teams, Zoom, or Hangouts can
          work as well. The teams need to schedule an hour at some point during
          the week for the team activity. This week is pretty critical as they
          will be setting up the project they will be working on over the next 4.5
          weeks and learning how to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students should start working on the Trello tasks during this lesson as well.
          They often start slowly. The goal should be for each team to complete
          one card per team member per lesson (in addition to the team card). For
          this lesson, however, you might suggest that they work as a team on the
          "Add item to cart broken" task. They might only get that one card
          done...and that is probably okay. It will get them into the code to
          become familiar with it. It also acts as a bit of an icebreaker for
          the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the cards are intended to be done as individuals...however,
          I have had groups ask if they can work on all of them together. I have
          allowed that with the idea that they work towards developing the
          confidence to complete cards on their own over the next few lessons.
        </p>
		<p>
          Help students to understand that the readings are important and encourage
          them to also look to other sources when things don't make sense. The
          book does a pretty good job, but the way it addresses some topics
          might be confusing to some students. Help them to remember that there
          are other options. Several are listed in this week's reading in fact.
          The notes they turn in do not have to all be from the assigned reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>
		<h3>L01 Midweek</h3>
        <!-- <p>
          For your meeting with them you might consider running through the
          tools they are asked to install. You might even initialize a simple
          Node application, and show them how to add packages. They will do more
          of that later in the week in the team activity.
        </p> -->
        <p>
          For your meeting I would review some JavaScript concepts. Array
          methods, fetch, promises, modules would all be good to review. Point
          out the resources in the syllabus for review! You could fetch some
          data from something like
          <a href="https://pokeapi.co" target="_blank">PokeApi</a>, or
          <a href="https://www.swapi.tech" target="_blank">Swapi</a>. Use the
          array methods to manipulate it, then build some HTML and output to the
          page as a demo.
        </p>
        <p>
          This
          <a href="../examples/poke-demo/index.html" target="_blank">example</a>
          shows one way you could go. It uses arrow functions...if you poll your
          students and they feel uncomfortable with that, you could start your
          demo with traditional anonymous functions and work into arrows. Get as
          far as you can while giving good explanations of what you are doing.
          You probably won't get everything in that example done.
        </p>
        <p>Recommended order:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pull information for the types first to review fetch and promises.
            Don't wrap the fetch call in a function initially
            (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/) Pull up the
            <a href="https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#types" target="_blank"
              >documentation</a
            >
            to show them how we know what URL to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then make a function to generate the HTML list to review DOM
            manipulation, and array methods (forEach), and you can use
            <kbd>data-</kbd> prefixed attributes to store the URL for each
            specific type.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attach a listener to the types list that will call a function called
            <code>typeClickedHandler</code> talk about how we need to make
            another call to the API, but the code would be very similar to what
            we wrote before...refactor to take our previous code and make it
            reusable with a function <code>getData(url, callback)</code>. Talk
            about the callback. Lets us define the action done with the returned
            data at runtime...very powerful!
          </li>
          <li>
            Finish implementing the <code>typeClickedHandler</code>, talk about
            the difference between <code>event.target</code>, and
            <code>event.currentTarget</code>. You will need to make another
            function to render the list of Pokemon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring up that unknown, and shadow have no Pokemon and create a
            function using <code>Array.filter</code> to remove them from our
            list of types.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you still have time do some CSS, including highlighting the
            currently selected type by adding a class when it is clicked.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Students who have come up through the new courses: CSE 121b and WDD
          230 should have already seen everything in that demo. It should be
          review...but many students will probably not recognize that.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might also use your demo to show working with GitHub. Initialize
          the repo...commit and push, even do a branch if you have time.
        </p>

		<h3>L02 End-of-Week</h3>
<p>
          I would spend some time talking about the Node.js based development
          environment we will be working in. Talk about the role of the package
          manager (npm), bundlers (using Snowpack...I know it's not exactly a
          bundler, but it's setup is very simple, it works well for multi-page
          apps, will run Babel on our code as well as minify, and it doesn't add
          a bunch of code so debugging looks cleaner), and task managers (npm).
        </p>
        <p>
          The readings for this lesson are on OOP, this, and modules. So it would be
          good to model a class based ESModule as well. Discuss DRY and the
          importance of organizing as part of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          You could code up something like this
          <a href="../examples/expenses/index.html" target="_blank"
            >Expense tracker</a
          >.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start by creating the following files in a new directory:
            <kbd>index.html</kbd>, <kbd>main.js</kbd>, and
            <kbd>ExpenseTracker.js</kbd>. Add the HTML base (! tab in Vs Code)
            with a script element bringing in <kbd>main.js</kbd>. Mention the
            first change with modules: we need to add
            <kbd>type="module"</kbd> to our script element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a title to the HTML and inputs to get a description, and amount,
            with a button to submit. Then add a div with an ID of output or
            something.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <kbd>main.js</kbd> add a listener to the button for a click. Have
            it use a function called <kbd>submit</kbd> as the handler. Stub out
            that function, grab the contents of the two inputs, add them to an
            object and console.log it out so we know it is working.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now to the module. In <kbd>ExpenseTracker.js</kbd> add a class
            called <code>ExpenseTracker</code>, add a constructor and talk about
            its role. Talk about re-usability. We might want more than one of
            these eventually, so let's pass in some sort of identifier so we can
            tell them apart. Use the constructor to store the label in the
            class. Mention that the class will need to know where to output the
            expenses, so pass in the ID of the output element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next add a method to the class called <kbd>addExpense</kbd>, it
            should expect an expense object. It should add the expense to the
            list of expenses (go back and add an empty array to the class in the
            constructor) then output the expense to HTML. for now just add a
            console.log outputting some success message.
          </li>
          <li>
            At this point I would stop and finish getting the module to work
            before finishing the functionality. Talk about
            <code>export</code> and <code>export default</code>. Add
            <code>export default</code> to the class. Then go back to
            <kbd>main.js</kbd> and talk about importing. Then create an instance
            of your class (<code
              >const janExpenses = new ExpenseTracker('Jan', 'output')</code
            >), and add <code>janExpenses.addExpense()</code> to the submit
            handler. Test to make sure everything is working.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will need a function to build the table we need, and another to
            build the contents of the table body. Create two functions called
            something like <kbd>renderTable</kbd>, and
            <kbd>renderExpenses</kbd> in our module. <kbd>renderTable</kbd> only
            needs to be called once, so we can do that in the constructor.
            <kbd>renderExpenses</kbd> needs to be called every time we add a new
            row to our expenses. I chose to add those two functions to the
            module outside of the class. I use this as an opportunity to talk
            about what should be in the class and publicly available, and what
            shouldn't. (And that this is often a matter of opinion.) :)
          </li>
          <li>
            Finish the render functions. Try to use examples of using the array
            helper methods whenever possible. Test to make sure everything is
            working.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next show how easy it is to reuse our class to create a listing for
            another month. Add a select element to the HTML to select a month.
            Also add a new div to hold the new expense table (#febOutput). In
            main.js create a new instance of our class:
            <code
              >const febExpenses = new ExpenseTracker('Feb', 'febOutput')</code
            >, then modify the submit handler to look at the selected value in
            our dropdown, and call the addExpense with the correct class
            instance.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have time then you could add another class method to
            calculate a running total and output that with each expense row. Or
            you could spend some time on CSS.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As you demo, take the opportunity to model debugging with the browser
          tools, and watch for opportunities to use the array methods like
          forEach, map, push, etc. in your code.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          You can use something like <code>console.dir()</code> on an array to
          show them what an array object looks like as well to introduce the
          array methods. (<code
            >array.includes(element) .push .pop .shift .unshift .slice .split
            .reduce .filter array.map(callback)</code
          >). Keep in mind that the team activity for next lesson will also be on
          the array methods.
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p>
          Your demo should show examples of using <code>const</code> and
          <code>let</code>, and contain a review of the three methods for
          declaring functions in JavaScript (function expression, function
          declaration, and arrow function). You could build on the
          <a href="../examples/calc/calc2.html" target="_blank"
            >calculator code from the team activity</a
