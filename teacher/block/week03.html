        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>L05 Midweek</h3>
        <p>
          The individual activity for this lesson is to apply more templating to
          our site. We will pull the header and footer into files and loaf them
          in with JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          The teams for the final project should meet before midweek to
          brainstorm and submit a list of project ideas. Help them navigate
          scope!
        </p>
        <h3>L06 End-of-Week</h3>
        <p>The reading for this lesson is on forms.</p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>
        <h3>L05 Midweek</h3>
        <p>
          For this meeting I would recommend spending a lot of time on
          debugging. You could use this project
          <a href="../examples/hikes/" target="_blank">hikes</a>
          as a starting point. It has a lot of errors in it. Students can
          download it from here:
          <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/wdd330/examples/hikes.zip"
            >https://byui-cit.github.io/wdd330/examples/hikes.zip</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Have them download it, run it, and start finding and eliminating bugs.
          You could do the first few together then turn them loose on some...or
          stay together...up to you. Emphasize a few things that students seem
          to struggle with:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Figuring out how to navigate through a project made up of multiple
            files and modules. They get lost easily and have a hard time
            following the flow. Open index.html and show the script src...this
            is the entry point. Open that file and set a breakpoint.
          </li>
          <li>Once the code is paused remind how to step over, step in.</li>
          <li>
            Explain how we can follow the execution of an application with
            stepping. You might step into a few functions and then draw
            attention to the call stack and explain the significance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inspect the values of variables and objects, talk about how we are
            looking to see if the values match what we expect...if not, how can
            we figure out why?
          </li>

          <li>
            Discuss examples of ways to avoid errors in our code. Such as if
            statements checking for the existence of data before we try to use
            it and using try/catch blocks to deal with errors more gracefully.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>L06 End-of-Week</h3>
        <p>
          This demo should review custom request headers, forms, and making POST
          requests instead of the simple GETs we have been doing. We do need
          some sort of a backend to do this though...this will require some
          special setup...see below.
        </p>
        <p>
          ...And here is a link to the project...<a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/wdd330/tree/main/examples/blog"
            target="_blank"
            >simple blog</a
          >. The link this lesson is to the repo...it won't function if the
          server part is not running...
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We need a backend to make our POST requests to. We can use
            <kbd>json-server</kbd> for this. Have the students create a
            directory for this lesson's demo. Inside of that create a
            <kbd>server</kbd> directory. Navigate to the directory in the
            terminal and type
            <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm init -y</code></pre>
            to create a new node-based project. Then type
            <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm install --save-dev json-server</code></pre>
            Finally open the <kbd>package.json</kbd> file and add this line to
            the <kbd>scripts</kbd> section:
            <pre><code class="lang-json"
              >"start": "json-server --watch ./database.json"</code
            ></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Create one more file in the <kbd>server</kbd> directory:
            <kbd>database.json</kbd> Then add the following line in that file:
            <kbd>{ { "posts": [] }</kbd>
          </li>
          <li>
            Because the LiveServer extension watches the project directory for
            changes to know when to reload, this database file will cause
            problems for us unless we ignore it since it will get changed each
            time we POST something to our server. Have the students type
            <code>cmd/ctrl-shift-p</code> then enter "open settings". They are
            looking for the "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)" option. Select it
            then go to "Extentions->Live Server Config->Settings: Ignore Files.
            Then click on the "Edit in settings.json". Add a line to ignore
            .json files in the server directory. It should look like this when
            they are done:
            <pre><code class="lang-json">"liveServer.settings.ignoreFiles": [
    "**/server/*.json",
    ".vscode/**",
    "**/*.scss",
    "**/*.sass",
    "**/*.ts"
]</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Start up our server by making sure you are in the
            <kbd>server</kbd> directory in the command line and typing
            <pre><code class="lang-bash">npm run start</code></pre>
            Remind the students that to end this process they should click in
            the command line to focus it...then type 'ctrl-c'.
          </li>
          <li>
            Up a level from the <kbd>server</kbd> directory create a few more
            files: index.html, main.js, DataService.js. Add some HTML to the
            index.html file...and a script element to link it to main.js
          </li>
          <li>
            Open DataService.js and create and export a class
            <code>export default class DataService</code>. Pass into the
            constructor the endpoint the instance will be used for. Create two
            methods: <code>getData()</code>, and <code>postData(data)</code> We
            will code up the post one first since otherwise there will be
            nothing to get.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set a variable at the top of our module for the base URL of our
            server...we could also reuse our convertToJson method
            <pre><code class="lang-js">
const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/';
async function convertToJson(res) {
    const data = await res.json();
    if (res.ok) {
      return data
    } else {
      throw { name: 'servicesError', message: data };
    }
}</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Spend a few minutes talking about REST. We have been doing GET
            requests up until now...since that is the default for Fetch. Talk
            about doing POSTs. We will need to set some custom request options.
            Below is a sample:
            <pre><code class="lang-js">const options = {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
}
const results = await fetch(baseUrl + this.endpoint, options).then(convertToJson);
return results;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Test the post method...check <kbd>database.json</kbd> to make sure
            the data is there. Then move on to the
            <code>getData()</code> method.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once getData is working move into the index.html file...create a
            form, add fields for name, description, and category. Talk about
            HTML validation...what we get for free, and add a submit button.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <kbd>main.js</kbd> add a <code>submit</code> listener to the
            form. Talk about preventDefault, we are submitting the form through
            AJAX so we don't want the default behavior to happen.
          </li>
          <li>
            You might mention that you can manually access the HTML form
            validation tools in JS: <code>form.checkValidity()</code> and
            <code>form.reportValidity()</code>
          </li>

          <li>
            What do we send to the server? We could go through and
            "document.querySelector" out all the form fields and build our
            object by hand...or we can leverage
            <kbd>FormData</kbd>. FormData creates a nice name:value pairing of
            each input in our form. Advantage: will easily capture all of the
            form fields and does the heavy lifting for you if you are uploading
            files through your form. Disadvantage: not all servers want
            FormData. Ours in fact wants JSON...but it is pretty easy to convert
            it for simple forms.
            <pre><code class="lang-js">
function formDataToJSON(formElement) {    
    let formData = new FormData(formElement);
    // Object.fromEntries creates a new object made from an iterable list like an Array or Map
    // Object.entries takes an object and converts it into an Array that is iterable.
    const converted = Object.fromEntries(formData.entries());
    // if we have radios or checkboxes which share the same name
      converted.tags = formData.getAll("tags");
    return converted;
}
          </code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
