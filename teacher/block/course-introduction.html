        <h2>Course Outline</h2>
        <p>
          This course attempts to simulate working on a real project in a real
          frontend team. The first 4.5 weeks will be spent adding features and
          fixing bugs on a project called SleepOutside, a simple outdoor gear
          retail site.
        </p>

        <h3>Team/Individual Activities</h3>
        <p>
          During most weeks the students will have an individual activity which
          they will complete on their own, as well as a team activity which they
          should complete in a peer programming style with their team. Following
          instructions in the W01 Icebreaker and Team Enrollment, students will
          self-enroll in a group (ideally 3-4 students each) for team activities
          throughout the semester. At midweek of W01, check to ensure that each
          student is in a group and that each group has between 3-4 students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the points for the team activities come from participation:
          only about 10% or so is for completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure to stress to them that peer programming means that one
          student drives...they are on the editor typing code. The rest of the
          team tells them what to type. Most of the input should come from those
          NOT typing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team/individual activities are used to make major changes to the
          application. The students will also be given a Trello board full of
          cards that fix bugs and add smaller bits of functionality. Teams
          should have the goal of completing at least one card per person in the
          team per week. Students should attempt the cards individually, but
          should feel welcome to reach out to their teammates for help as
          needed.
        </p>
        <p>A typical week should have the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Reading assignments: ~2hrs</li>
          <li>Team & individual activities: ~4-6hrs</li>
          <li>Trello cards: ~3hrs</li>
          <li>Professor led instruction: ~1hr (recorded weekly office hour)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Final Project</h3>
        <p>
          Part two is weeks 5-7 and will be spent building the frontend of a new
          application that the teams have planned earlier in the course. There
          will still be readings, but no more team activities.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructor Time Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          The course is designed to minimize the amount of time you spend
          grading to allow for more time teaching and giving individualized
          attention to students that need it. Each week the students are
          required to turn in either notes or worked exercises. You should
          review those with the goal of extracting questions to address with the
          class. Encourage your students to include their questions in their
          notes!
        </p>
        <p>
          They will submit a weekly SCRUM-style report of status in I-Learn.
          These reports are your best tool for finding students whom you may
          need to reach out to. Grade this activity on completion. Feel free to
          dock a few points on the notes if you feel they are putting in minimal
          effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should plan on holding an office hour each week. Record this for
          those that can't make it. Use this time to answer any questions you
          find in the notes or that the students attending bring, and then work
          on a coding example illustrating skills from the readings. Each week
          in the Teaching Notes I'll give an example project...use mine or feel
          free to come up with your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also consider preparing a short video introduction for each
          week to help the students plan their time.
        </p>
        <h2>Final Grades</h2>
        <p>
          The grading for the course is a bit different. 30% of the grade will
          be made up of the weekly notes and team/individual activities. The
          other 70% will be based off of a self-evaluation that the student
          performs. They will assess themselves on how well they have achieved
          the outcomes of the course, prepare a short video with their
          justifications, and then provide a portfolio of work to back up their
          claims. You should review their marks and their submitted work and
          adjust as necessary. A major part of that portfolio should be their
          final team project.
