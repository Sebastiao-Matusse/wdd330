        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week is a continuation of last week. The
          students should have successfully submitted an order to the server,
          but we did not handle the response, or deal with validation to make
          sure the user gives us good information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reading for this week introduces JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The team
          activity next week will address authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remind the students that their project proposals are due this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          For your meeting it might be helpful to grab a Trello card from the
          SleepOutside project and work on it together with the students. Model
          especially the planning phase as students often struggle getting
          started. The cards for sprint 3 are more complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively you could model requesting a token with a
          username/password and using it in requests.
