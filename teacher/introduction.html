        <h2>Course Outline</h2>
        <p>
          This course attempts to simulate working on a real project in a real
          frontend team. The first 9 weeks will be spent adding features and
          fixing bugs on a project called SleepOutside, a simple outdoor gear
          retail site.
        </p>

        <h3>Team Activities</h3>
        <p>
          During most weeks the students will have a required team activity that
          they should complete in a peer programming style. You can decide
          whether to form the groups yourself, or allow the students to self
          select. I recommend 3-4 students per group. Most of the points for
          these activities come from participation...only about 10% or so is for
          completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure to stress to them that peer programming means that one
          student drives...they are on the editor typing code. The rest of the
          team tells them what to type. Most of the input should come from those
          NOT typing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team activities are used to make major changes to the application.
          The students will also be given a Trello board full of cards that fix
          bugs and add smaller bits of functionality. Teams should have the goal
          of completing at least one card per person in the team per week.
          Students should attempt the cards individually, but should feel
          welcome to reach out to their teammates for help as needed.
        </p>
        <p>A typical week should have the following:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Reading assignment: 1-2hrs</li>
          <li>
            Team activity: ~2hrs (If face-to-face 1hr of this will be classtime)
          </li>
          <li>Trello Cards: ~3hrs</li>
          <li>
            Professor led instruction: ~1-1.5hrs (either scheduled class or a
            weekly recorded office hour if online)
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Final Project</h3>
        <p>
          Part two is weeks 10-14 and will be spent building a new application
          that the teams have planned earlier in the course. There will still be
          readings, but no more team activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may choose to coordinate with a CSE 341 instructor to have the
          students work across courses. This course would build the frontend of
          an application, and the students from the other course would build the
          backend.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructor Time Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          The course is designed to minimize the amount of time you spend
          grading to allow for more time teaching and giving individualized
          attention to students that need it. Each week the students are
          required to turn in either notes or worked exercises. You should
          review those with the goal of extracting questions to address with the
          class. Encourage your students to include their questions in their
          notes!
        </p>
        <p>
          They will also either arrange a meeting once a week between you and
          the team for a SCRUM style standup meeting, or you can have them
          submit that weekly report of status in Ilearn. These reports are your
          best tool for finding students whom you may need to reach out to. I
          would grade both of these activities on completion. Feel free to dock
          a few points on the notes if you feel they are putting in minimal
          effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can make it work the synchronous meeting report is WAY more
          effective than the Ilearn one. I highly recommend it if you can make
          it work. It would involve a 10-15 minute appointment for each group
          each week.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should plan on holding an office hour each week. Record this for
          those that can't make it. Use this time to answer any questions you
          find in the notes or that the students attending bring, and then work
          on a coding example illustrating skills from the readings. Each week
          in the Teaching Notes I'll give an example project...use mine or feel
          free to come up with your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also consider preparing a short video introduction for each
          week to help the students plan their time.
        </p>
        <h2>Final Grades</h2>
        <p>
          The grading for the course is a bit different. 30% of the grade will
          be made up of the weekly notes and team actities. The other 70% will
          be based off of a self-evaluation that the student performs. They will
          assess themselves on how well they have achieved the outcomes of the
          course, prepare a short video with their justifications, and then
          provide a portfolio of work to back up their claims. You should review
          their marks and their submitted work and adjust as necessary. A major
          part of that portfolio should be their final team project.
