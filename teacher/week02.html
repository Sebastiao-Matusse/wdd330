        <h2>Week 2 Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The first team activity happens this week. There will be one during
          most of the weeks. Groups should have been formed last week. The
          activities are intended to be done in peer programming style. For
          online you might suggest something like multiplayer in
          <a href="https://repl.it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >repl.it</a
          >
          to code together, or screen sharing in Teams, Zoom, or Hangouts can
          work as well. The teams need to schedule an hour at some point during
          the week for the team activity. This week is pretty critical as they
          will be setting up the project they will be working on over the next 7
          weeks and learning how to use it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Again with the readings, encourage them also to look to other sources
          when things don't make sense. The book does a pretty good job, but the
          way it addresses some topics might be confusing to some students. Help
          them to remember that there are other options. Several are listed in
          this weeks reading in fact. The notes they turn in do not have to be
          all from the assigned readings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students should start working on the Trello tasks this week as well.
          They often start slowly. The goal should be for each team to complete
          one card per team member per week (in addition to the team card). For
          this week however you might suggest that they work as a team on the
          "Add item to cart broken" task. They might only get that one card
          done...and that is probably ok. It will get them into the code to
          become familiar with it. It also acts as a bit of an icebreaker for
          the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the cards are intended to be done as individuals...however
          I have had groups ask if they can work on all of them together. I have
          allowed that with the idea that they work towards developing the
          confidence to complete cards on their own over the next few weeks.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>
        <p>
          I would spend some time talking about the NodeJs based development
          environment we will be working in. Talk about the role of the package
          manager (npm), bundlers (using Snowpack...I know it's not exactly a
          bundler, but it's setup is very simple, it works well for multi-page
          apps, will run Babel on our code as well as minify, and it doesn't add
          a bunch of code so debugging looks cleaner), and task managers (npm)
        </p>
        <p>
          The readings this week are on OOP, this, and modules. So it would be
          good to model a class based ESModule as well. Discuss DRY and the
          importance of organizing as part of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          You could code up something like this
          <a href="../examples/expenses/index.html" target="_blank"
            >Expense tracker</a
          >.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start by creating the following files in a new directory:
            <kbd>index.html</kbd>, <kbd>main.js</kbd>, and
            <kbd>ExpenseTracker.js</kbd>. Add the HTML base (! tab in Vs Code)
            with a script element bringing in <kbd>main.js</kbd>. Mention the
            first change with modules: we need to add
            <kbd>type="module"</kbd> to our script element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a title to the HTML and inputs to get a description, and amount,
            with a button to submit. Then add a div with an ID of output or
            something.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <kbd>main.js</kbd> add a listener to the button for a click. Have
            it use a function called <kbd>submit</kbd> as the handler. Stub out
            that function, grab the contents of the two inputs, add them to an
            object and console.log it out so we know it is working.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now to the module. In <kbd>ExpenseTracker.js</kbd> add a class
            called <code>ExpenseTracker</code>, add a constructor and talk about
            it's role. Talk about re-usability. We might want more than one of
            these eventually, so let's pass in some sort of identifier so we can
            tell them apart. Use the constructor to store the label in the
            class. Mention that the class will need to know where to output the
            expenses, so pass in the ID of the output element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next add a method to the class called <kbd>addExpense</kbd>, it
            should expect an expense object. It should add the expense to the
            list of expenses (go back and add an empty array to the class in the
            constructor) then output the expense to HTML. for now just add a
            console.log outputting some success message
          </li>
          <li>
            At this point I would stop and finish getting the module to work
            before finishing the functionality. Talk about
            <code>export</code> and <code>export default</code>. Add
            <code>export default</code> to the class. Then go back to
            <kbd>main.js</kbd> and talk about importing. Then create an instance
            of your class (<code
              >const janExpenses = new ExpenseTracker('Jan', 'output')</code
            >), and add <code>janExpenses.addExpense()</code> to the submit
            handler. Test to make sure everything is working.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will need a function to build the table we need, and another to
            build the contents of the table body. Create two functions called
            something like <kbd>renderTable</kbd>, and
            <kbd>renderExpenses</kbd> in our module. <kbd>renderTable</kbd> only
            needs to be called once, so we can do that in the constructor.
            <kbd>renderExpenses</kbd> needs to be called everytime we add a new
            row to our expenses. I chose to add those two functions to the
            module outside of the class. I use this as an opportunity to talk
            about what should be in the class and publically available, and what
            shouldn't. (and that this is often a matter of opinion :)
          </li>
          <li>
            Finish the render functions. Try to use examples of using the array
            helper methods whenever possible.Test to make sure everything is
            working.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next show how easy it is to re-use our class to create a listing for
            another month. Add a select element to the html to select a month.
            Also add a new div to hold the new expense table (#febOutput). In
            main.js create a new instance of our class:
            <code
              >const febExpenses = new ExpenseTracker('Feb', 'febOutput')</code
            >, then modify the submit handler to look at the selected value in
            our dropdown, and call the addExpense with the correct class
            instance.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have time then you could add another class method to
            calculate a running total and output that with each expense row. Or
            you could spend some time on CSS.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As you demo take the opportunity to model debugging with the browser
          tools, and watch for opportunities to use the array methods like
          forEach, map, push, etc. in your code
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          You can use something like <code>console.dir()</code> on an array to
          show them what an array object looks like as well to introduce the
          array methods. (<code
            >array.includes(element) .push .pop .shift .unshift .slice .split
            .reduce .filter array.map(callback)</code
          >). Keep in mind that the team activity for next week will also be on
          the array methods.
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p>
          Your demo should show examples of using <code>const</code> and
          <code>let</code>, and contain a review of the three methods for
          declaring functions in javascript (function expression, function
          declaration, and arrow function). You could build on the
          <a href="../examples/calc/calc2.html" target="_blank"
            >calculator code from the team activity</a
          >
          (partially converted using an object or
          <a href="../examples/calc/calc3.html" target="_blank"
            >fully converted to an object</a
          >), or build a
          <a href="random.html" target="_blank"
            >random sentence generator as an example</a
          >.
        </p> -->
