        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week will have us start making changes to
          the Sleepoutside site. We will begin making it dynamic instead of
          static. We start with the product detail page. Currently we have one
          html file per product. This is not scalable so we will make one html
          page that will load in the details we desire.
        </p>

        <p>
          The students will also begin adding some structure to the code by
          creating our first couple modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again with the readings, encourage them also to look to other sources
          when things don't make sense. The book does a pretty good job, but the
          way it addresses some topics might be confusing to some students. Help
          them to remember that there are other options. Several are listed in
          this weeks reading in fact. The notes they turn in do not have to be
          all from the assigned readings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          For your meeting with them continue to give examples of building
          dynamic DOM, using events, organizing with modules, and leveraging
          things like the array methods that Javascripr gives us.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might then do something like this
          <a href="../examples/quotes/index.html" target="_blank"
            >dynamic filterable list of quotes</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to get into the browser developer tools as much as possible to
          troubleshoot.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start with a new directory and index.html, main.js, and
            QuoteGetter.js files.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the HTML we need a select element, a button, and a list to output
            the quotes to.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <kbd>main.js</kbd> we initially need to attach an event listener
            to our button. It needs to grab the selected option in our select.
            Test to make sure the listener works.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then start on the QuoteGetter module. Create a class. I would
            recommend passing in the ID of the select element, and the output
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next we need to get the list of quotes. (A list can be found at
            https://type.fit/api/quotes) Create a method to retrieve them, then
            store them as part of the class
          </li>
          <li>
            Next we need to extract a unique list of author names from the quote
            list. One way you could do this is to create a Set and map the
            author into the Set. Sets automatically remove duplicates.
            <code>new Set(quotes.map(quote=> quote.author))</code>. Then convert
            it to an array and return it. <code>[...authors]</code>. You will
            need to spend a few minutes talking about Sets and Spread
          </li>
          <li>
            Next take the author list and build them as options in our select in
            the HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            Either in the class constructor, or in an init method we need to
            make sure that we do all the setup required: get the quotes, make
            the author list, and build the select based on the list.
          </li>
          <li>
            I would pause to get everything wired up and test. (Import the class
            into <kbd>main.js</kbd>. create an instance, call init if that's how
            you approached it. Do some console.logging or use breakpoints to
            make sure things are working.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Next we need a method to filter our quote list by an author. It
            should take an author as argument, and return a list of quotes by
            that author.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally we need a function or method that will take a list of quotes
            and output it as HTML.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This is also a good time to remind students about issues that may
          arise from javascript executing before the DOM is loaded. Talk about
          ways to avoid those problems (onload listener, adding the script at
          the bottom of the body, or using the <code>defer</code> flag on your
          script element...<code>type="module"</code> actually defers it as
          well.)
