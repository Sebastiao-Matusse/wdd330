        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week will have us start making changes to
          the Sleepoutside site. We will begin making it dynamic instead of
          static. We start with the product detail page. Currently we have one
          html file per product. This is not scalable so we will make one html
          page that will load in the details we desire.
        </p>

        <p>
          The students will also begin adding some structure to the code by
          creating our first couple modules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again with the readings, encourage them also to look to other sources
          when things don't make sense. The book does a pretty good job, but the
          way it addresses some topics might be confusing to some students. Help
          them to remember that there are other options. Several are listed in
          this weeks reading in fact. The notes they turn in do not have to be
          all from the assigned readings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          For your meeting with them continue to give examples of building
          dynamic DOM, using events, organizing with modules, and leveraging
          things like the array methods that Javascript gives us.
        </p>
        <h3>New demo: SWAPI</h3>
        <p>
          Link to a finished version:
          <a href="../../examples/sw/v3/index.html">Swapi demo</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This week might be a good week to spend a bit of time trying to
          understand others code, as well as working on some CSS. You could
          start by giving the students this javascript module:
          <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/wdd330/examples/sw/swapidemo.zip"
            >swapidemo.zip</a
          >. Begin by opening it up in your editor and walk through a few things
          with them. Point out the overall structure...there are three sections:
          templates, exports, helpers
        </p>
        <p>
          Note the try/catch blocks in some of the functions. Explain a bit
          about them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Point out as well in the <code>getListDetails</code> function the use
          of Promise.all()
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have pointed out a few things instruct the students to create
          <kbd>index.html</kbd> and <kbd>main.js</kbd> files. Then have them
          write the HTML and JS code necessary to get the module to display a
          list of Star wars movies.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point draw attention to the links we generated. Point out the
          url param and talk about how we can process them.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a film.html and film.js file</li>
          <li>
            In film.js console.log out <code>window.location</code> and discuss
            what is there. Point out <code>search</code> in particular.
          </li>
          <li>
            Show how <code>URLSearchParams()</code> can be used to parse the
            search params.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then the <code>.get(param)</code> method can be used to pull
            specific params from the object.
          </li>
          <li>
            <pre><code class="lang-js">const queryString = window.location.search;
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString);
const filmId = urlParams.get("filmId");</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            You might turn the students loose again to finish getting the
            <kbd>film.html</kbd> page implemented...or you can finish together.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          After they get the module working spend any remaining time writing
          some CSS for the page to dress it up. Basic layout would be
          good...adding margin and padding to give whitespace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively you could add some loading animations that will show
          while we wait for the planets, etc to finish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another alternative would be to dig a bit further into the
          <code>window.location</code> object and show how you can check to see
          which page you are currently on...and use that to combine main.js and
          films.js
        </p>
        <h3>Old demo</h3>
        <p>
          You might then do something like this
          <a href="../examples/quotes/index.html" target="_blank"
            >dynamic filterable list of quotes</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to get into the browser developer tools as much as possible to
          troubleshoot.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start with a new directory and index.html, main.js, and
            QuoteGetter.js files.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the HTML we need a select element, a button, and a list to output
            the quotes to.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <kbd>main.js</kbd> we initially need to attach an event listener
            to our button. It needs to grab the selected option in our select.
            Test to make sure the listener works.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then start on the QuoteGetter module. Create a class. I would
            recommend passing in the ID of the select element, and the output
            element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next we need to get the list of quotes. (A list can be found at
            https://type.fit/api/quotes) Create a method to retrieve them, then
            store them as part of the class
          </li>
          <li>
            Next we need to extract a unique list of author names from the quote
            list. One way you could do this is to create a Set and map the
            author into the Set. Sets automatically remove duplicates.
            <code>new Set(quotes.map(quote=> quote.author))</code>. Then convert
            it to an array and return it. <code>[...authors]</code>. You will
            need to spend a few minutes talking about Sets and Spread
          </li>
          <li>
            Next take the author list and build them as options in our select in
            the HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            Either in the class constructor, or in an init method we need to
            make sure that we do all the setup required: get the quotes, make
            the author list, and build the select based on the list.
          </li>
          <li>
            I would pause to get everything wired up and test. (Import the class
            into <kbd>main.js</kbd>. create an instance, call init if that's how
            you approached it. Do some console.logging or use breakpoints to
            make sure things are working.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Next we need a method to filter our quote list by an author. It
            should take an author as argument, and return a list of quotes by
            that author.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally we need a function or method that will take a list of quotes
            and output it as HTML.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This is also a good time to remind students about issues that may
          arise from javascript executing before the DOM is loaded. Talk about
          ways to avoid those problems (onload listener, adding the script at
          the bottom of the body, or using the <code>defer</code> flag on your
          script element...<code>type="module"</code> actually defers it as
          well.)
