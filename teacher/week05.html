        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week is to apply more templating to our
          site. This week we will pull the header and footer into files and loaf
          them in with javascript
        </p>
        <p>
          the teams for the final project should be organized by this week as
          well. the students from both classes should meet this week and
          brainstorm a list of project ideas.
        </p>

        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          This week for the meeting I would recommend spending a lot of time on
          debugging. You could use this project
          <a href="../examples/hikes/" target="_blank">hikes</a>
          as a starting point. It has a lot of errors in it. Students can
          download it from here:
          <a href="https://byui-cit.github.io/wdd330/examples/hikes.zip"
            >https://byui-cit.github.io/wdd330/examples/hikes.zip</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Have them download it then run it and start finding and eliminating
          bugs. You could do the first few together then turn them loose on
          some...or stay together...up to you. Emphasize a few things that
          students seem to struggle with:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Figuring out how to navigate through a project made up of multiple
            files and modules. They get lost easily and have a hard time
            following the flow. Open index.html and show the script src...this
            is the entry point. Open that file and set a breakpoint.
          </li>
          <li>Once the code is paused remind how to step over, step in.</li>
          <li>
            Explain how we can follow the execution of an application with
            stepping. You might step into a few functions and then draw
            attention to the call stack and explain the significance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inspect the values of variables and objects, talk about how we are
            looking to see if the values match what we expect...if not how can
            we figure out why?
          </li>

          <li>
            Discuss examples of ways to avoid errors in our code such as if
            statements checking for the existance of data before we try to use
            it and using try/catch blocks to deal with errors more gracefully.
          </li>
        </ol>
