        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This week is all about foundation. All of the tools we will be using
          will be introduced, along with ideas about workflow in modern frontend
          development. Time can also be spent on reviewing the Javascript
          concepts from the syllabus that they students are expected to know.
          There is no team activity for this week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure the students understand the grading structure. 30% comes
          from reading and team activities. 70% from self evaluation and
          portfolio. The self evaluations will happen twice: once at midterm,
          and once at the end of the semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          Explain the way the course will work. They will be working in groups
          through the whole semester. Those groups need to be formed this week.
          2-3 per group ideally. You might talk about some of the ideas in the
          <a
            href="https://byui-cit.github.io/advcss/resources/working-with-groups.html"

          document. The first 9 weeks will be spent modeling what a typical web
          frontend project might look like. They will work together to build a
          simple ecommerce site. Some will be done all together in a peer
          programming model. Other parts will be done individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last part of the course will be spent building an application of
          the student's choosing. They will be paired up with students in CSE
          341 (Backend Development II) This class will be responsible for
          building the Frontend, the other students will build the backend and
          they must work together!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a high emphasis on working effectively as a team in the
          course. Using tools like linters, bundlers, and Github are also
          stressed. The students will be expected to branch, pull request and
          merge with their projects. You may choose to spend some time talking
          about that this week as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Help them to understand that the readings are important and encourage
          them also to look to other sources when things don't make sense. The
          book does a pretty good job, but the way it addresses some topics
          might be confusing to some students. Help them to remember that there
          are other options. Several are listed in this weeks reading in fact.
          The notes they turn in do not have to be all from the assigned
          reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>

        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          For your meeting with them you might consider running through the
          tools they are asked to install. You might even initialize a simple
          Node application, and show them how to add packages. They will do more
          of that next week in the team activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or you could review some Javascript concepts. Array methods, fetch,
          promises, modules would all be good to review. Point out the resources
          in the syllabus for review! You could fetch some data from something
          like
          <a href="https://pokeapi.co" target="_blank">PokeApi</a>, or
          <a href="https://www.swapi.tech" target="_blank">Swapi</a>. Use the
          array methods to manipulate it, then build some html and output to the
          page as a demo.
        </p>
        <p>
          This
          <a href="../examples/poke-demo/index.html" target="_blank">example</a>
          shows one way you could go. It uses arrow functions...if you poll your
          students and they feel uncomfortable with that you could start your
          demo with traditional anonymous functions and work into arrows. Get as
          far as you can while giving good explanations of what you are doing.
          You probably won't get everything in that example done.
        </p>
        <p>Recommended order:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pull information for the types first to review fetch and promises.
            Don't wrap the fetch call in a function initially
            (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/) Pull up the
            <a href="https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#types" target="_blank"
              >documentation</a
            >
            to show them how we know what URL to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then make a function to generate the html list to review DOM
            manipulation, and array methods (forEach), and you can use
            <kbd>data-</kbd> prefixed attributes to store the url for each
            specific type.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attach a listener to the types list that will call a function called
            <code>typeClickedHandler</code> talk about how we need to make
            another call to the API, but the code would be very similar to what
            we wrote before...refactor to take our previous code and make it
            reusable with a function <code>getData(url, callback)</code>. Talk
            about the callback. Lets us define the action done with the returned
            data at runtime...very powerful!
          </li>
          <li>
            Finish implementing the <code>typeClickedHandler</code>, talk about
            the difference between <code>event.target</code>, and
            <code>event.currentTarget</code>. You will need to make another
            function to render the list of pokemon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring up that unknown, and shadow have no pokemon and create a
            function using <code>Array.filter</code> to remove them from our
            list of types.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you still have time do some CSS, including highlighting the
            currently selected type by adding a class when it is clicked.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Students who have come up through the new courses: CSE 121b and WDD
          230 should have already seen everything in that demo. It should be
          review...but many students will probably not recognize that.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might also use your demo to show working with Github. Initialize
          the repo...commit and push, even do a branch if you have time.
