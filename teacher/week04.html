        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The readings for this week cover a fairly wide variety of topics.
          Debugging is one, then Single Page Applications, and finally the HTML
          Template element. Plan on spending some time addressing questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team activity continues our work at making the site dynamic by
          addressing the product list on the home page. It does introduce using
          a Template element. So you will want to include that in your demo this
          week.
        </p>

        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          To help the students prepare for the team activity you might do
          something like this
          <a href="../examples/sw/index.html" target="_blank"
            >SW Film information</a
          >
          app. It uses the HTML template element to model one way of providing
          re-usable HTML to our code.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start by creating a new directory and files: index.html, main.js,
            SwapiHelper.js.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue by brainstorming a list of tasks that need to be done. It
            might look something like this:
            <pre>
get list of films
output list of films
when a film is clicked:
    get detailed info on film
    output film details
    for each planet
        get planet info
        render planet with planet template
    for each species
        get species info
        render with template
    for each starship
        get info
        render with template
    for each vehicle
        get info
        render with template</pre
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            You might turn the students loose on the first two steps as review
            of what we have learned in previous weeks. They can use
            <kbd>https://swapi.dev/api/films</kbd> to get the initial info they
            need.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once they are done have a conversation about the method they wrote
            to get the info from the API. What happens if something goes wrong?
            Harden the method with try/catch. Also make sure that what the
            students came up with is re-usable...we will be making lots of
            different requests with that method.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the code to handle a click on a film. Talk about how we will be
            using the same HTML to output all of the planets for example. In the
            past we have used functions to generate the HTML, we could also use
            a <kbd>template</kbd> in the HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a <kbd>template</kbd> element to the <kbd>head</kbd> of our
            index.html file.
          </li>
        </ol>
