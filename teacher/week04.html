        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The readings for this week cover a fairly wide variety of topics.
          Debugging is one, then Single Page Applications, and finally the HTML
          Template element. Plan on spending some time addressing questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team activity continues our work at making the site dynamic by
          addressing the product list on the home page. It does introduce using
          a Template element. So you will want to include that in your demo this
          week.
        </p>

        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also this week you should coordinate with the CSE 341 instructor if
          you are doing hte cross course team project. The teams should be
          formed this week so the students can meet next week
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          To help the students prepare for the team activity you might do
          something like this
          <a href="../examples/sw/index.html" target="_blank"
            >SW Film information</a
          >
          app. It uses the HTML template element to model one way of providing
          re-usable HTML to our code. I realize that this is not a common way.
          The truth is most folks let their framework handle the templating, or
          include something like mustache or handlebar as part of their
          development workflow...But I feel that this is helpful in getting the
          students to think through some of the issues that must be addressed
          with templating, without introducing another tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a more complex demo. Lots going on. Focus on try/catch to
          harden their code first, then using templates, then making multiple
          requests for data and building a more complex page last.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start by creating a new directory and files: index.html, main.js,
            SwapiHelper.js.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pull up the SWAPI documentation for the
            <a href="https://swapi.dev/documentation#films" target="_blank"
              >film endpoint</a
            >. Note that some of the information is listed as lists of links.
            Continue by brainstorming a list of tasks that need to be done if we
            wanted to display this information. It might look something like
            this:
            <pre>
get list of films
output list of films
when a film is clicked:
    get detailed info on film
    output film details
    for each planet
        get planet info
        render planet with planet template
    for each species
        get species info
        render with template
    for each starship
        get info
        render with template
    for each vehicle
        get info
        render with template</pre
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            You might turn the students loose on the first two steps as review
            of what we have learned in previous weeks. They can use
            <kbd>https://swapi.dev/api/films</kbd> to get the initial info they
            need. Stress reuseability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once they are done have a conversation about the method they wrote
            to get the info from the API. What happens if something goes wrong?
            Harden the method with try/catch. Also make sure that what the
            students came up with is re-usable...we will be making lots of
            different requests with that method.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the code to handle a click on a film. Talk about how we will be
            using the same HTML to output all of the planets for example. In the
            past we have used functions to generate the HTML, we could also use
            a <kbd>template</kbd> in the HTML.
          </li>
          <li>
            Write the method in SwapiHelper to retrieve the details about a film
            when it is clicked. In this case we can just filter the list of
            films that we already have if it was saved to the class (suggest
            they do that if they did not). Go ahead and output the film name and
            opening crawl to our HTML. Add an unordered list with a class or id
            as well to hold the list of planet information.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each of the planets returned with the film data, we need to make
            a request to the api with the URL provided. This is a great
            opportunity to talk about resolving a list of Promises with
            Promise.all().
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a <kbd>template</kbd> element to the <kbd>head</kbd> of our
            index.html file to display a planet. Might look something like this:
            <pre><code class="lang-markup">&lt;template id="planet"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h4 class="planet-name"&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Climate:&lt;span class="planet-climate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Terrain:&lt;span class="planet-terrain"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Year: &lt;span class="planet-year"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Day: &lt;span class="planet-day"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Population: &lt;span class="planet-population"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            We now need a method to retrieve our template from the html, clone
            it, insert the data for a planet, and attach it to the list in the
            DOM. There is one in the team activity for this week we could use as
            a model if you think enough students have already completed that by
            the time you are doing your demo.
            <kbd>utils/renderListWithTemplate</kbd>. We also need a function to
            insert the planet details into our template clone. Talk about how an
            element can be used to call <code>querySelector</code> to limit our
            search.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pull it all together...get the details on the list of planets, pass
            it to the render function, hydrate and attach. You might also spend
            a few minutes on CSS to style the list of planets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Talk about how with the work we have done adding the starships,
            vehicles, and species would be pretty easy...we just need to add the
            template to the html, and create a prepare function to load the
            data. If you have time show this with starships.
          </li>
