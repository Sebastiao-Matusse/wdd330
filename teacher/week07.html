        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week asks the students to finish the
          checkout process. They will need to create a checkout form, then
          submit the correct information to a server. The server lives at
          <a href="http://157.201.228.93:2992/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://157.201.228.93:2992/</a
          >. Check to make sure it is up!
        </p>

        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>
        <p>
          The reading for this week introduces CSS transitions and animations.
          An example I often use is to start with
          <a
            href="https://codepen.io/matkat/pen/EKaNZg"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >these boxes</a
          >
          and will change them (transform, size shape color, location) with
          transitions to demo the basics. I'll finish with a bouncing ball or
          make a box go around the content div (slide corner to corner all the
          way around). Then you might build something like this:
          <a href="../examples/poke-animation/poketest.html" target="_blank"
            >PokeApi Demo with animation</a
          >
          to review Ajax and add the sliding transition effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by coming up with the list of steps we might follow to solve the
          problem. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
  /*
  create an element with a list to hold the names of the pokemon
  create a container to hold the details of the pokemon
  place the containers side by side, make them each the size of the screen
  hide the details element (overflow:hidden on main)

  get the list of pokemon
  display the list of pokemon in the list element
      make sure to include the url for the pokemon details in the html
  attach a listener to the pokemon list when clicked:
      get the details for the correct pokemon
      insert the details into the details element
      slide the list and the details elements left 100vw
  Add a back button to the details element.
  attach a listener to the button, when clicked:
      slide list and details 100vw right
*/
        </pre>
      </main>
