        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week asks the students to finish the
          checkout process. They will need to create a checkout form, then
          submit the correct information to a server. The server lives at
          <a href="http://157.201.228.93:2992/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >http://157.201.228.93:2992/</a
          >. Check to make sure it is up!
        </p>

        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>
        <p>
          The reading for this week introduces CSS transitions and animations.
          An example I often use is to start with
          <a
            href="https://codepen.io/matkat/pen/EKaNZg"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >these boxes</a
          >
          and will change them (transform, size shape color, location) with
          transitions to demo the basics. I'll finish with a bouncing ball or
          make a box go around the content div (slide corner to corner all the
          way around). Then you might build something like this:
          <a href="../examples/poketest.html" target="_blank">PokeApi Demo</a>
          to review Ajax and add the sliding transition effect.
