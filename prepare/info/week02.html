          This lesson all of the assigned readings will be from the
          <a href="https://javascript.info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >Modern Javascript Tutorial (javascript.info)</a
          >
          site. Remember: if you are having trouble understanding a concept the
          way that this book presents it...go find another source!
        </p>
        <p>Keep in mind the following Tips from the first reading as well.</p>
        <div class="callout">
          <h2>Tips</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Read for understanding, not completion. This means that some
                weeks when the concepts settle quickly in your mind you will fly
                through the reading. Other weeks you might have to read several
                times...and spend lots of time working through the code examples
                until you understand. You may even need to go find a few extra
                sources on your own for some topics.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Don't skip the code examples! Make sure to spend time reviewing
                these. With the book we are using you can actually interact with
                the code samples directly. If you have time you should also work
                through the exercises at the end of each chapter.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Take good notes! One of the most important things that you can
                include in your notes are questions that arise in your mind as
                you read. Having this list will help you to know what topics
                need more time, and will give you something to say when the
                instructor asks: "Do you have any questions from the reading?"
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If there's a chapter in the book that's not assigned, it is not
                because those topics are not important...but often because you
                are expected to already understand those concepts from a
                previous course. You may want to read some of those unassigned
                chapters if the topics look unfamiliar to you.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                There is not a specific list of exercises given because
                <strong>not everyone needs the same thing</strong>. This course
                is designed to give you the flexibility to spend your time in
                the areas you need, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach
                where you spend all your time for the week on concepts that you
                may have already mastered. This approach will frustrate some of
                you, but becomes very powerful once you adjust to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, you might read through the chapter on Functions and
                maybe the author's explanation left some questions in your mind
                about arguments. So you do a quick search which turns up this
                article about
                <a
                  href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/how-to-use-arguments-and-parameters-in-ecmascript-6/"
                  target="_blank"
                  >How to Use ES6 Arguments and Parameters</a
                >. Then you visit the list of exercises below and find this list
                of
                <a
                  href="https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-functions-exercises.php"
                  target="_blank"
                  >JavaScript Functions</a
                >
                that will give you as much practice as you need writing
                functions that use arguments and parameters.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Again, don't be afraid to find your own sources! Sometimes the
                way an author explains a concept will not compute with your
                brain. Go find another explanation! As a starting point, here
                are some additional resources you have free access to:
